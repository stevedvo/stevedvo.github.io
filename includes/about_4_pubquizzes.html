<p>I like all sorts of quizzes and panel games at home and on the telly: Trivial Pursuit, QI, Have I Got News For You, University Challenge - and I do rather enjoy taking part in pub quizzes when the opportunity arises.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I - and the small team of 2/3 that I might be part of - very rarely do well enough to beat the competition of older/wiser/larger teams, but it is always good fun to sink a few pints of ale and have a go.</p>
<p>There are a couple of local pubs that I have found put on a quiz every week or two, and have a fine selection of real ales to boot:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://dmleaning.wix.com/whiteharthotel" target="_blank">The White Hart</a> - quiz every Tuesday evening with food served halfway through</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.waggonandhorsesbeckhampton.co.uk/home" target="_blank">Waggon And Horses</a> - quiz on alternate Thursdays</li>
</ul>
