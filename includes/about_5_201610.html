	<h4>30 October 2016</h4>
	<p>> Have been doing bits & bobs with my computer in the evenings this week to continue to get it back up to where it was before one of the hard drives died. One thing I needed to re-do was installing the Win10 Anniversary Update which I'd done sometime last month - and it transpired that it was this update that had messed-up the Macrium Reflect backups: the way that applications communicate with the Task Scheduler API has apparently changed, and I needed to update Macrium Reflect to compensate for it. Of course, Macrium Reflect had not auto-updated for the same reason! Bit of a pain, but at least I am aware of it now, and my backup software is now running a compatible version and working as it should.</p>
	<p>> The hard drive that died was part of a 2-disk RAID, and I was now relying on using the 2nd disk only. The worrying thought occurred that since both disks were the same age and had gotten exactly the same usage out of them, it was surely only a matter of time that the surviving HD would be failing itself - sooner rather than later! The SMART utility was reporting a "Warning" rather than "Good" status, which further added to the worry! To check this out, I downloaded a disk diagnostic tool from Western Digital to see if there is anything up with the surviving HD. Ran the quick check and it said it was OK but left it running overnight for a more detailed analysis.</p>
	<p>> The Disk Diagnostic tool did not report any major issues, but I decided not to risk it! Have been fancying an upgrade to an SSD for a little while, and this seemed like an ideal opportunity to go for it! I also did a little research into what other upgrades I could sort out for my desktop PC: at 7+ years old it is getting a little long in the tooth and could use some extra speeding up. Despite the manual for the PC saying that it already has the max memory of 4GB installed, I have been curious for a long time about whether I could go beyond that. Reading some forums online it seems that I can get up to 8GB - which would be a MASSIVE help on the system speed. Win10 works on 4GB but it works the hard drive quite hard with all the paging! So I went for it: RAM upgrade + new SSD ordered :D</p>
	<p>> My new SSD drive arrived the following day from Amazon Prime. Removed the dead HD from it's bay [I'd only disconnected it previously], and inserted the new SSD in it's place after placing it in a 2.5" -> 3.5" mounting bracket. Formatted the drive in Windows, then rebooted into the Macrium Recovery disk to do a clone of the boot disk. But after a couple of attempts this was not working for some reason, so I booted back into normal Windows and performed the same procedure from the normal environment: worked fine! Took an hour or so to do the clone, then I rebooted and changed the boot drive to the new SSD which worked absolutely fine. Slight issue with the re-assignment of drive letters, though, so spent a little bit more time shutting down & rebooting a couple of times to disable extra CD/HD/USB drives and gradually re-introduce them to organise the lettering better.</p>
	<p>> Computer certainly feels much snappier now. Boots up quicker, shuts down quicker [not that I would do much of that], and opens apps quicker. Hopefully the RAM boost that is planned will do even more to keep it running quickly - but that delivery is not due for another couple of weeks.</p>

	<h4>23 October 2016</h4>
	<p>> Have been busy this weekend moving the office at home from the spare bedroom into the dining room, to make way for our new baby boy due in early January! It was all going fairly well, emptying the drawers, cupboards and stuff, moving all the office furniture down into the dining room, including dis- and re-assembling the corner desk, putting together the baby furniture.</p>
	<p>> Gave my computer a good clean out with some airduster spray. Has been a while since I last did this and there was a fair build-up of gunk which felt good to remove! The bad news was that when I tried to reboot the computer one of the drives on the striped RAID wouldn't power on properly: I could hear the heads clicking away but getting nowhere :(. This drive was one-half of the RAID that the system was trying to boot from, so I was unable to boot into an OS.</p>
	<p>> The combined capacity of the two hard drives in the RAID was ~500GB, of which I was using less than half, so I had the idea that actually I COULD manage in the short-term with only one of the hard drives - but I would need to re-partition / re-format it to function as a standalone drive. I disconnected the sick HD from the power & SATA and booted into the RAID config to remove the RAID entirely. I have been using <a href="http://www.macrium.com/reflectfree.aspx" target="_blank">Macrium Reflect</a> for a little while now to keep regular backups/images of my hard drives onto a large external HD - so I knew I'd have at least some reference point to rebuild my system from. Used a Macrium boot CD that I'd made prior to upgrading to Win10 to get into a UI where I could format the good drive from the RAID and start copying back over the boot disk image.</p>
	<p>> I only have 250GB available now with the one drive but the disk image is only 180GB so it should be OK. May need to invest in an SSD drive, though. Was a little surprised to find that the disk image is a little old - dated 01-Sep. I set Macrium Reflect to take a full disk image every month, but for some reason the scheduled October image never happened. In any case, it's better than nothing - and I take more regular backups of other individual & more important files so there shouldn't be much lost.</p>
	<p>> The image restore worked nicely, but when I got into Windows everything was running quite slowly. A lot of automated updates and other processes were kicking in since as far as the operating system was concerned it hadn't been booted up for around 7 weeks! Some very recently modified files had not been backed up since their very latest changes, but I was able to restore almost everything.</p>

	<h4>16 October 2016</h4>
	<p>> It's been a while since my last entry - it has been a rather busy few weeks with having a wedding and a honeymoon, followed immediately by starting a new job! Will try and keep my blog updated periodically, but daily updates might be a bit of a stretch!</p>
	<p>> The first couple of weeks at my new job have been going rather well. I have been working on minor changes/fixes to various WordPress sites whilst I build up my knowledge of the various clients that we work with and I can demonstrate what level my development skills / knowledge are at.</p>
