		<h4>28 April 2016</h4>
		<p>> After a few days off, gotten my head back into website mode. Made excellent progress in sorting out the sizing of the background gradient fill and background image. Switched it around so that the image is the background and the gradient fill just comes from a 1px x 2px jpg that gets stretched according to the window size. Had to fiddle a bit with the opacity settings and some position attributes to make sure each page looked right. Easy when you know how - but took me a while to get there!!</p>
		<p>> Been having my first little play around with CSS media queries to see if I can display different images depending on the device width.</p>
		<p>> Successfully got the background image to change on the specified breakpoint, which looks a lot better. Also whilst playing with media queries I have adjusted the layout of the secondary burger menu to be all right-aligned. Primary burger menu could use a little attention.</p>

		<h4>22 April 2016</h4>
		<p>> Revisited the appearance of the semi-transparent background image and the linear gradient. Researched a little bit on the Google dev tools and W3C pages for different ways of displaying images. Not completed the re-coding just yet - been somewhat distracted by the World Championship snooker!</p>
		<p>> Also just removed the left- and right-padding on the .container-fluid class as it seemed unnecessary and is there by default on the Bootstrap CSS. Looks better now IMO on all screen types.</p>

		<h4>20 April 2016</h4>
		<p>> Downloaded the full minified Bootstrap css, javascript, fonts, etc to remove reliance on online CDNs.</p>
		<p>> Split all the content from each section into separate html files, which are called through the PHP includes() function. Seems to be a good idea for ease of editing: rather than trawling through a potentially huge html file with all the content in it you can open up just the relevant file.</p>
		<p>> Also, was able to remove duplicate content in the &lt;head&gt; section by referencing all common &lt;link&gt;, &lt;meta&gt;, and &lt;script&gt; elements to one container document. So if I need to add an extra library to each page I just need to now edit one document instead of several. Wish I'd done this before changing the Bootstrap href on them all earlier today!</p>

		<h4>19 April 2016</h4>
		<p>> Added a new page: "Sepsis". Trawled the <a href="http://sepsistrust.org/" target="_blank">UK Sepsis Trust</a> website for relevant & accurate information, and organised everything into sections, which are shown/hidden according to click events in the same way as other pages. Spent a lot of time trying to get some Twitter feeds embedded on the social section, but they would not display properly - either visible on other sections, or hidden from view on the section where they should be seen. Tried inserting various bits of CSS / jQuery code but couldn't get the behaviour quite right, so have had to make do with href anchors instead :(.</p>

		<h4>18 April 2016</h4>
		<p>> Worked today with Bootstrap & jQuery to make the site look better on mobile screens: coded the "burger menus" to slide in & out on clicking, and configured the visibility of the burger & standard menus according to the size of the screen that is being used.</p>
		<p>> Scratching head to figure out why the site displayed on my iPhone did not match the user-agent-spoofing on Chrome. First thought was an issue with the update to iOS 9.3.1 that I'd done earlier in the day, since the site was displaying as expected on an older iPhone without the newest update. However, tried clearing all the cookies and browsing data on Safari and it then worked! Made a slight tweak to the navitem click event to fade out the green background rather than keeping it set.</p>

		<h4>15 April 2016</h4>
		<p>> Thought of lots more things to add to the website "To Do" list: created additional issues for these in GitHub.</p>
		<p>> Modified the <a href="tictactoe.php">Tic Tac Toe</a> game to work on click events rather than dragging & dropping to make it more mobile-friendly.</p>
		<p>> Re-arranged the social buttons & top navigation on the header. Put the $page_title on the header. Changed the nav items on the top & left nav to use Bootstrap buttons, including playing around with additional CSS to get them displaying & positioned nicely.</p>
		<p>> Added Favicon.</p>
		<p>> Added site to Google Webmaster tools and spent a little time tinkering around with the settings & suggestions. Uploaded a sitemap. Will check on later to see how the site fairs on the reports.</p>

		<h4>14 April 2016</h4>
		<p>> Tweaked the CSS & JavaScript to ensure that the sections display as intended for both the Homepage and AstroPics.</p>
		<p>> Cropped/Resized all AstroPics images and used Bootstrap to control how these are viewed depending on screen size. For thumbnails, used jQuery to add a title attribute and a click event to open up a larger version of the image in a new window. Uses string manipulation from the source of the image that is clicked to determine the filename of the larger image to be shown, then queries the user's display resolution to create a window of the correct size to fit the screen. Quite pleased with that - seemed rather clever :)</p>
		<p>> Added a new page - <a href="animation.php">Animation</a> - to demonstrate some of the canvas manipulation that I've learned - drawing a couple of different shapes with various fill styles, and animating it.</p>

		<h4>13 April 2016</h4>
		<p>> Spent another huge chunk of time trying to get the #wrapper div [and corresponding gradient fill] to change dynamically. Accessing the heights of various properties e.g. div height, document height, window height, etc. For one reason or another, just can't get everything to work together. Settled for a solution, but not ideal as the div is always as tall as the section with most content, even if that section is hidden - which allows you can scroll into nothing. It'll do for now, spent far too much time on this already!!</p>
		<p>> Moved on to some work on the AstroPics page. Rather than displaying everything all at once, have broken this down into sections for a:) a more logical browsing experience; and b:) reducing load times.</p>

		<h4>12 April 2016</h4>
		<p>> Continuing to add more content to the "about me" section.</p>
		<p>> Structured the blog in a better way and added more detail.</p>
		<p>> Made a better job of the logic that sorts out the dynamic resizing of the background image as the window size is changed.</p>
		<p>> Spent a loooong time trying to work out how to get the #wrapper div to change dynamically correctly as the window is resized or different content is displayed, to ensure that the gradient fill displays as expected. Still a work in progress!</p>

		<h4>11 April 2016</h4>
		<p>> Working on the left nav on the homepage. Added additional sections to break down the "about me" blurb and used some CSS styling and jQuery effects to snazz it up a bit.</p>
		<p>> Adding more content to each of the "about me" sections.</p>

		<h4>10 April 2016</h4>
		<p>> Downloaded the jQuery and jQueryUI libraries to the site to allow use of these offline.</p>
		<p>> Realised I was duplicating a lot of &lt;head&gt; info in the php pages and the html content that is pulled from the require() function. Removed the duplication for hopefully a little performace benefit.</p>

		<h4>07 April 2016</h4>
		<p>> Had the power out for an electrical inspection for several hours so not a lot of progress today - just added some additional lines in the &lt;head&gt; for Bootstrap stuff. Tried to plan ahead for the outage by creating all the branches on Git and having various reference websites opened up so I could work offline on my local machine and just push the changes once the router was back up. One thing I didn't think of was that I am using Bootstrap and jQuery over CDNs, so as soon as I lost my Internet connexion the CSS on the website died :( #n00b</p>
		<p>> Spent my time doing some self studying instead - learning about the HTML5 canvas from my <a href="http://lpmj.net" target="_blank">Learning PHP, MySQL & JavaScript</a> book.</p>

		<h4>06 April 2016</h4>
		<p>> So much to do to get the site anywhere near how I'd like it! Decided to take a structured disciplined approach: broke everything down into "user stories" and raised these as issues on GitHub. For every issue I can create a separate branch from Master to make all the changes, then merge in to Master when I'm happy that the issue is complete.</p>
		<p>> Had the background set as a linear gradient, which is nice, but also liked the idea of also having a nice picture of the Andromeda galaxy [M31]. Decided to have both, and researched how to change the opacity of a background image.</p>
		<p>> Need to ensure that the background image looks good on all devices. Added some JavaScript to set the image an appropriate size depending on the initial viewport size, then change dynamically as the window is resized.</p>

		<h4>05 April 2016</h4>
		<p>> Added a couple more [mostly blank] html pages to put together a very basic shell to navigate around, including a header.</p>
		<p>> Incorporated Bootstrap & jQuery libraries to enhance the look/style of the site.</p>
		<p>> More content needed!</p>
		<p>> Repeating the header on every html page far from efficient: changed the pages to php and using require() to point to separate html files which contain the header and page content.</p>
		<p>> Site no longer loads... realised that the freebie site offered by Git only supports static content e.g. no support for PHP or any other dynamic content. Seems I'll have to upload changes to the site by FTP!! #retro</p>
		<p>> Still using Git for branches & version control.</p>
		<p>> Added a section to showcase some of the Astronomy Pics that I've taken over the years.</p>
		<p>> Added <a href="tictactoe.php">Tic Tac Toe</a> game to play.</p>
		<p>> Added Twitter widget to the header.</p>
