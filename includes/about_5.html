		<h4>07 June 2016</h4>
		<p>> Completed adding the content to the BOINC section. Happy with this - the jQuery vertical tabs are working very nicely. Spent a little time looking into how to animate the show() for the tabs to match the effect that I'd programmed myself in JavaScript for other pages (home, astropics, sepsis). The animation seemed a little clunky with the vertical tabs tbh and didn't look quite as nice, so removed the animation code.</p>
		<p>> On reflection, the standard vertical tabs DO work ever so nicely, and having the tabs open up instantly rather than through an animated effect does give a better user experience I think! The point of loading everything on the page initially is so that there are no further time-costly requests as you navigate to different sections, so it really defeats the object when you're waiting around for an animation to display a section that has been selected - even if it only 1,000 milliseconds (or whatever I choose the setting to be). So I've decided that I'll convert these other pages to using the vertical tabs without any animation effects. This also has the advantage of solving a few other niggles:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Upon loading some of the pages - the Home page especially - there is a delay of 500-1,000ms whilst the CSS & jQuery sorts out which sections should be visibile/hidden, and there is a noticeable period where all the sections can be seen overlaid atop one another. U-G-L-Y! Converting this to vertical tabs will hopefully speed this up and remove this unwanted effect.</li>
			<li>Should hopefully resolve the issue with the "Music" sub-section of "Hobbies & Interests" not displaying the background correctly on mobile devices since the content is too large. The vertical tabs seem to do a pretty good [read: better!] job at adjusting the page background image & gradient on the fly as different tabs are selected - but then if I wasn't trying to animate it I wouldn't have had all these issues in the first place! #fml</li>
			<li>Will substantially reduce the main JavaScript filesize - therefore marginally reducing the load times albeit probably imperceptibly.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>> Made good headway with converting the Homepage to use the vertical tabs rather than my previous jQuery animation method. Lots of .classes and #IDs to unpick from the CSS & JavaScript. Got it to a point where it is working well on mobile screens (where tabs are replaced with selectmenus), but having issues on larger screens where a selectmenu doesn't seem to embed very well into the tabs.</p>
		<p>> Didn't really have time to work through this fully - got quite distracted with the arrival of a new 3TB external hard drive that I'd ordered yesterday. Intention was to hook it up to my Apple Airport Extreme Base Station and use as a network drive for backups and media storage, but after a few failed attempts realised that the file format [NTFS] was incompatible with the AEBS. Was able to format to FAT-32, which works with both Apple AND Windows, but it didn't work too well. Was surprised actually that I managed to format a 3TB drive at all in that format! Transferring small files to the drive seemed to work OK, but larger files e.g. the movies that the drive was intended for just hung. Gave the AEBS up as a crap idea, re-formatted the drive as NTFS and connected directly to my PC. Transferred lots of movies & TV shows that I've previously ripped from DVDs, added to iTunes library and shared across the LAN for the Apple TVs to pick up. Have more files to transfer from another laptop but the concept is sound.</p>

		<p>> Back on it briefly after a few days off!</p>
		<p>> First thing, made sure this Blog was up to date with the work I'd done last Thursday & Friday. Had been working on the code right up until the last minute to test different CSS configurations and not allowed time to add Blog updates.</p>
		<p>> Added a few new issues on GitHub for things that I'd been thinking about. Some minor, some major, but always good to jot them down to ensure they are not forgotten either way.</p>
		<p>> Had a little bit of time to finish sorting out the text & background colour of the vertical nav menu on the BOINC page. Made the last of the necessary adjustments in CSS and in JavaScript/jQuery to ensure the desired colours on page load, hover, mouseout.</p>

		<p>> Between baking scones and apple & rhubarb crumble, packing bags, and sorting various other things for a long weekend away, I've not had a lot of time on the website today :(. Did make a little progress with continuing to figuring out how to hook into various aspects of the CSS default & hover effects to change the appearance of the jQuery vertical tabs to my liking.</p>

		<h4>26 May 2016</h4>
		<p>> Added a new page today: <a href="boinc.php">BOINC</a>. Easy enough to add the navigation to the header and put together the basic page structure. Decided on this occasion I'd like to have a go at using jQuery vertical tabs to navigate between sections of the page. Realised this would be no good for mobile users so implemented a selectmenu for small screens which is replaced by the vertical tabs on larger displays. The whole default colour scheme for the jQuery tabs is so far from my website I need to sort out a load of extra CSS to override the default behaviour. Made a start on this, to be continued tomorrow.</p>

		<h4>25 May 2016</h4>
		<p>> Decided that the html file that contained all of the "Hobbies & Interests" was now getting waaaaaaaaaay too big and unwieldy to navigate around from one section to the next, so chopped each of the sub-sections up into separate files and used PHP include to incorporate them into the flow of the main document.</p>
		<p>> Did some further work on the 'Stand Up' sub-section: similarly to the 'Music' sub-section I wanted to provide links to Facebook, Twitter, Wikipedia, and their own website for each comedian of interest. With what I'd learned from the "Music" section I implemented this slightly differently and hopefully more efficiently by coding a PHP array, accessing each record over a foreach loop, and using spaghetti code to incoporate the PHP variables with the HTML code that goes around it.</p>
		<p>> It does seem a better way of doing it - and halfway between straight linear code and having these records stored in a SQL database which will be the ultimate endgoal.</p>
		<p>> WOOP WOOP!!  With the latest updates to my master branch I have now surpassed 100 commits to my GitHub repo #winning :D</p>

		<h4>23 May 2016</h4>
		<p>> Understanding a little about using a .htaccess file and basic routing. Updated the way that the info in the &lt;head&gt; sections is pulled in for each page so that ALL the &lt;script&gt;s and &lt;link&gt;s are loaded for every page, not just the common ones for jQuery, Bootstrap, etc. - and the pages that had additional JS & CSS (e.g. <a href="tictactoe.php">Tic Tac Toe</a> and <a href="animation.php">Animation</a>) no longer need their own extra lines in their &lt;head&gt; sections.</p>
		<p>> Added links to astronomy.com and Scientific American on the <a href="links.php">Links</a> page.</p>
		<p>> Discovered that I'm now getting console errors relating to the Animation and Tic Tac Toe JavaScript files. The JS is trying to access elements on the page that don't exist because the appropriate page hasn't been loaded. Will undo some of the changes I made to the &lt;head&gt; sections to unbreak this!</p>

		<h4>20 May 2016</h4>
		<p>> Using my new 'Music' sub-section this morning to navigate to the Wikipedia pages for a couple of bands whose CDs I received in the post, realised that several of the links are not working correctly. Had not taken into account that the Wikipedia URLs are all case-sensitive past the first character! Had tested a couple of them yesterday and it seemed to be fine but I must have only clicked on single-word names. So I proceeded to work my way through all of those links, replacing all the lowercase characters with uppercase where required, then doing proper testing that all of the links work - and work directly i.e. no re-directs.</p>
		<p>> Added the 'Astronomy' sub-section to the "Hobbies & Interests" section.</p>
		<p>> Un-commented the additional options in the "Hobbies & Interests" section. Decided that with the menu items having a transparent background it made it difficult to read where there was other text behind it, so set the background to a solid black colour instead which raises a wry smile considering my earlier work on the <a href="#20160513">13th</a> & <a href="#20160516">16th!</a></p>
		<p>> Added content to the 'Baking' sub-section.</p>

		<h4>19 May 2016</h4>
		<p>> After a long long long l-o-n-g time I completed adding in all of the Facebook, Twitter and Wikipedia links for all of the bands/artists listed in the music section.</p>
		<p>> Checked how it all looks on various screen types, and made all the necessary Bootstrap & CSS adjustments to ensure good readability and clickability.</p>
		<p>> Fixed a couple of other little Bootstrap/CSS bugs I noticed right on the border between the "xs", iPad, and "sm" screen sizes.</p>
		<p>> Pretty happy with the Music section now. A much larger task than I envisioned after typing up all the prose at the beginning and then painstakingly looking up every link and inserting the correct URL into each href.</p>
		<p>> The only issue I've found now is that due to the way the number of columns change with the screen width, on mobile views the "Hobbies & Interests" section is now longer than the "Blog" section, but on wider screens the opposite is true. This is causing a slight display issue due to the way I've had to label which section is the largest to ensure that the background gradient & image is filled all the way down the page. If I nominate the "H&I" section as now being the largest it will mess up the bottom of the "Blog" unless I split the latter up into smaller sections with the selectmenu function... but a month of blog entries lumped together seems like the minimum sensible amount. So maybe I keep the blog as the largest section and just ensure that there is always plenty of content in each of the sub-sections i.e. not moving anything out of 'Latest' until it leaves the sub-section with plenty of content remaining, and not allowing any sub-section to contain too little. All this waffling should help haha!</p>
		<p>> Alternatively I could try to figure out some better way of ensuring the background image & gradient fill the sections all the way down... but I spent a ridiculous amount of time trying to figure out how to get it working and I'm loathed to have to revisit it. It would make things easier if I ditched the fold-out animation that happens when you click on the navigation items [since it would allow the wrapper height to be looked-up], but I really like that feature.</p>

		<p>> Added a date/time section to the header, which auto-updates every second.</p>
		<p>> Adding more content to the "Hobbies & Interests" section. Starting with "Music" - which may well end up being one of the largest sections.

		<p>> Was just browsing the AstroPics page on my phone this morning, and was confused why tapping the link for "Other" kept taking me to "Special Events". Only took me a couple of seconds to find the appropriate piece of code and realise that the list item had the incorrect class so just needed to change a single character of code to fix it. This "bug" must have been there for aaaaaaaages - can't believe I'd not spotted it until now!</p>
		<p>> Added a bunch more links & screenshots to cover numerous useful & interesting astronomy & science websites.</p>

		<h4>16 May 2016</h4>
		<p>> Continued the work I started on Friday with the Blog periods. Looked up how to implement the tabs in jQuery, and it seemed simple enough: just add a few extra lines of code to contain all of the sections within a "tabs" div, with an unordered list as an index that provides the tab names; then one line of JavaScript to initiate the tabs in jQuery. SimpleZ!</p>
		<p>> I first of all commented-out all the code I'd previously done which related to the &lt;select&gt; menu to ensure there were no conflicts - just to check that the code for the tabs was working OK. Despite the simplicity, the appearance was not what I was expecting: the page was just displaying the unordered list, but the functionality was correct since clicking on the list items would show/hide the expected Blog sections.</p>
		<p>> Upon investigation it didn't take me long to discover that the tabs depended on an additional jQuery-UI CSS stylesheet that I'd not inluded in the &lt;head&gt; section. And THEN the thought occurred that maybe this missing stylesheet was the reason that the jQuery "selectmenu" function was not displaying as intended on Friday!</p>
		<p>> Including the missing stylesheet fixed the tabs and left them working nicely, although the colour-scheme doesn't match the rest of the site but that can be tweaked. Commented out all this code, then went back to re-coding the "selectmenu" function for the drop-down box method of choosing a Blog period. And you know what? When you include all the files you're supposed to the formatting works!! Just needed some slight adjustments to the colour-scheme and positioning, but in very short order I got the selection menu pretty much how I wanted... AND this jQuery menu has much more configurability and I was able to set more of it to being transparent against the background.</p>
		<p>> So now: happy with the tabs functionality, and happy with the menu functionality and appearance when they are implemented separately. The trick now is to work out how to implement one for mobile and the other for larger displays...</p>
		<p>> After some time showing this, hiding that, trying different things with Bootstrap, @media queries, and JavaScript 'if' statements, I've not quite been able to achieve what I set out to do. I can get the selectmenu to only appear on larger displays easily enough but the tabs are quite tricky and I've not gotten them to display correctly whilst that selectmenu code is active. Upon reflection, I've decided that now that I've got the jQuery selectmenu working I do actually prefer this way of choosing the Blog periods be it on mobile or larger devices. So I've scrapped all of the tabs code, but it was a good thing to learn about and I'll try to find a way to implement that elsewhere.</p>
		<p>> Used the time that I might have spent [in attempting to get the tabs displaying nicely] to further refine the CSS that controls the select menu effects/appearance.</p>
		<p>> Added an extra link for the offical <a href="http://www.formula1.com" target="_blank">Formula 1</a> homepage - I realised yesterday that this would be handy for accessing the Live Timings, etc.</p>

		<h4>13 May 2016</h4>
		<p>> Tackling a new issue today: splitting up this blog into different periods, so that one can jump straight to posts from different months without having to scroll a long way down the page. My idea is that for mobile devices I will enable this option through a drop-down selection box, and for larger screens I'll implement this as selectable tabs. So starting on the mobile option first of all.</p>
		<p>> Thought I was making quite quick progress to begin with by using some examples given on the jQuery website - using the "selectmenu" function it does exactly what I want: shows/hides the relevant section depending which option is chosen from the list. Problem is though that this implementation adds an additional div at the bottom of the document, and tries to figure out the correct position, width, CSS styles, etc. It just wasn't displaying nicely no matter how much I tried to configure it - the main gripe being the width & position settings causing the div to overflow outside of the viewport! Tried tweaking this for a little while but could not get it looking right - which was a shame because the functionality was really good!</p>
		<p>> So I gave up on this way of doing it and instead had a go at programming this myself. Took a fair chunk of time, mainly on trying to figure out how to access the values of, and initiate click events for, the &lt;option&gt; items within the &lt;select&gt; menu. Turns out that there is no click event handler for &lt;option&gt; elements but found a way around it, and then after a little trial & error dumping stuff to the <code>console.log</code> I figured out how to manipulate which sections should be shown/hidden (using display: block/none) at the expected times. Woop! One slight gripe is that although I can make the &lt;select&gt; background transparent, I can't find a way to make the drop-down &lt;option&gt; menu similarly transparent - I'm limited to solid colours so opted for black rather than the default white. Now to work on the tab version for the larger displays...</p>

		<h4>12 May 2016</h4>
		<p>> Added some more links & screenshots to the <a href="links.php" target="_blank">Links</a> page, and did some more re-organisation and Bootstrap-tweaking.</p>
		<p>> Made the top navigation a little more responsive: since adding an extra button ["Links"] this meant that there was a narrow band of screen sizes in the "sm" Bootstrap category where the navigation bar was too long and wrapping around onto two lines. Fixed this with some media queries to set the buttons to the default size and remove some additional padding on "sm" screens, and for larger displays set the buttons to the larger size and re-instate the padding. Works well, but this is only a temporary measure... as the site grows and more buttons are added to the top navigation bar I will need to figure out a better solution.</p>
		<p>> Made a couple of Bootstrap tweaks to the Astro Pics page. I DID have this working fine yesterday, but then some of the CSS tweaks I made this morning affected the AstroPics containers as well as the screenshots so just needed a couple of extra .clearfix divs to ensure tidyness on all screen types.</p>
		<p>> Was getting a little peeved at the social links/widgets on the header when viewed on one of the standard (i.e. non-mobile) displays. The Twitter one in particular always seemed to slow things down as the code taken from their support page had all sorts going on with loading iframes and running scripts and stuff. Literally added at least 2 seconds to the page load each time. So I recreated it with a Bootstrap button, overriding the default styles to emulate the appearance of the Twitter widget. Both social links now much simpler, using local images, and loading much faster :D</p>

	<article id="20160511">
		<h4>11 May 2016</h4>
		<p>> Continued the work I started yesterday with adding numerous iframes into the <a href="links.php" target="_blank">Links</a> section. Got so far with it, and had 15 or so iframes loading into the page... but it didn't look great and didn't work great. As suspected, it took f-o-r-e-v-e-r [well, 60-90 seconds] to load the page and make all the requests [approx 1,000!!]. And then when all the iframes DID finally load, the parts of the pages that were visible were not what I wanted. Depending on how well the destination page could cope with narrow viewports the results varied. I COULD have spent a while playing with CSS & JS to set the scroll height & width upon loading... but considering how long it took to load everything in the first place I gave that idea up!</p>
		<p>> So instead I changed the links page to just display a load of screenshots which link to the pages on a new tab. Visited each of the destination pages to take the screenshots and trim/resize to suitable dimensions. Once confirmed that all the images & links worked correctly I re-organised them into categories and then checked how it all looked on different screen sizes. Needed a few tweaks with the .clearfix div class.</p>
		<p>> Removed some duplicate headings that were apparent on pages within my site that didn't have a secondary navigation.</p>
		<p>> I liked the way I'd used Bootstrap to display the screenshots for the <a href="links.php" target="_blank">links</a> - much better than how I'd dealt with the thumbs/images on the <a href="astropics.php" target="_blank">Astro Pics</a> page. So I used the same logic to improve the look of the latter. Also made a few CSS / Bootstrap tweaks to improve the appearance of the secondary burger menu.</p>

		<h4>10 May 2016</h4>
		<p>> Continued the work with the CSS / Bootstrap / @media queries to improve the look of the site across a variety of screen types/sizes:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Adjusted the widths of some of the images and Bootstrap grid columns to different %s to behave more reponsively.</li>
			<li>Re-jigged the column widths and arrangement of the social links, and added different icons to appear when viewing on smaller screens.</li>
			<li>Changed the h1 heading to h2 to allow a better fit on the smallest mobile screens.</li>
			<li>Removed the "async" attribute from the script call that loads the main JS file - realised this was causing an issue with the burger menus not being initially hidden when viewing the site on my phone, although this was not apparent with the user-agent-spoofing.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>> Feeling quite happy with the look and functionality of the headers & menus on across all devices now :D</p>
		<p>> Added meta descriptions to each of the pages to hopefully help with Google search results. Was going to add meta keywords too but reading up a little about it I see these are very old hat and no longer have any influence with site rankings!</p>
		<p>> Had a response from the 123-Reg tech support team regarding the problem experienced with the web.config file contents - turns out they had omitted to include a particular opening & closing tag. Google still reckons I don't have GZIP compression enabled, however! #fml</p>
		<p>> Generated a new sitemap and updated in Google webmaster tools. Google seems to have forgotten that I previously submitted one!? Also now getting a crawl error saying that /mobile and /m don't exist. WTF?? Why is Google even trying to find these non-existent pages that I've never even tried to access?</p>
		<p>> Was getting a couple of errors on the live site [but not on test env] relating to the glyphicon-halflings woff and woff2 filetypes. Found a few lines of code to add to the web.config file to make that go away.</p>
		<p>> Added a new section: <a href="links.php" target="_blank">Links & Resources</a>. The intention is to use a bunch of iframes and screenshots to display numerous useful links - kinda like a "favourites" menu but with some pages pre-loaded to see the latest info at a glance. May be quite slow to load the page, though, as it will likely require a lot of requests.</p>

		<p>> HAPPY STAR WARS DAY!</p>
		<p>> Remembered that I can actually access my local webserver over the LAN - so I can point my iPhone Safari browser to my laptop's local IP address and view the dev version of the site on mobile without having to upload to live. Woop!</p>
		<p>> The problem seems to be that the background image is NOT obeying the "fixed" and "cover" attributes that should be set - the image should not scroll.</p>
		<p>> OK, so reading up about it this is a common problem! Attempted a few different ways of trying to get around this "bug". Thought I was onto a winner with a bit of JavaScript that adjusts the background position by the amount that the page has been scrolled by. This still did not work on the iPhone, and although it worked on the PC the repositioning of the background with REALLY clunky and was not the beautiful smooth scroll that you get when it's just set to "fixed" & "cover".</p>
		<p>> Spent several hours trying to figure out some other solution but getting nowhere. I can at least test what the actual outcome is with my iPhone now, but I don't have an iPad to hand to test what happens there. Had to come to a compromise with some @media queries that displays the background as a repeating scrollable image on mobile/tablets. Not 100% happy but moving on now!</p>
		<p>> Looking at improving SEO and performance:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Added a config file to enable GZIP compression.</li>
			<li>Changed the 2 pixel gradient image file format from jpg to png.</li>
			<li>Changed the ordering of the main CSS.</li>
			<li>Added an "async" attribute to the external script calls where possible i.e. not critical for initial page load.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>> Oh... the website now just shows an HTTP 500 error when I try to load it. Figured it must be something to do with the web.config file that has been added to the root directory for the GZIP compression, since taking this file out resolves the issue! Copied and pasted the file contents exactly as instructed on the 123-Reg support page so it seems a little strange that this would kill it. Removed the config file for now.</p>
		<p>> Started doing some tweaking / fine-tuning with the CSS / Bootstrap / @media queries to get the margins, padding, spacing, widths, etc for various sections looking better throughout the site on each screen type.</p>

Read up a little more on the CSS @media queries and played about to change the CSS depending on orientation rather than display width.

		<h4>28 April 2016</h4>
		<p>> After a few days off, gotten my head back into website mode. Made excellent progress in sorting out the sizing of the background gradient fill and background image. Switched it around so that the image is the background and the gradient fill just comes from a 1px x 2px jpg that gets stretched according to the window size. Had to fiddle a bit with the opacity settings and some position attributes to make sure each page looked right. Easy when you know how - but took me a while to get there!!</p>
		<p>> Been having my first little play around with CSS media queries to see if I can display different images depending on the device width.</p>
		<p>> Successfully got the background image to change on the specified breakpoint, which looks a lot better. Also whilst playing with media queries I have adjusted the layout of the secondary burger menu to be all right-aligned. Primary burger menu could use a little attention.</p>
		<p>> After uploading these latest changes to the live site, discovered that the background image is NOT actually displaying as intended on my iPhone - despite what Chrome's user agent spoofing is telling me. Hmmm... tricky - how can I test any changes are working correctly before I upload to the live site if the dev tools don't report properly?!</p>

		<h4>20 April 2016</h4>
		<p>> Downloaded the full minified Bootstrap css, javascript, fonts, etc to remove reliance on online CDNs.</p>
		<p>> Split all the content from each section into separate html files, which are called through the PHP includes() function. Seems to be a good idea for ease of editing: rather than trawling through a potentially huge html file with all the content in it you can open up just the relevant file.</p>
		<p>> Also, was able to remove duplicate content in the &lt;head&gt; section by referencing all common &lt;link&gt;, &lt;meta&gt;, and &lt;script&gt; elements to one container document. So if I need to add an extra library to each page I just need to now edit one document instead of several. Wish I'd done this before changing the Bootstrap href on them all earlier today!</p>

		<h4>19 April 2016</h4>
		<p>> Added a new page: "Sepsis". Trawled the <a href="http://sepsistrust.org/" target="_blank">UK Sepsis Trust</a> website for relevant & accurate information, and organised everything into sections, which are shown/hidden according to click events in the same way as other pages. Spent a lot of time trying to get some Twitter feeds embedded on the social section, but they would not display properly - either visible on other sections, or hidden from view on the section where they should be seen. Tried inserting various bits of CSS / jQuery code but couldn't get the behaviour quite right, so have had to make do with href anchors instead :(.</p>

		<h4>18 April 2016</h4>
		<p>> Worked today with Bootstrap & jQuery to make the site look better on mobile screens: coded the "burger menus" to slide in & out on clicking, and configured the visibility of the burger & standard menus according to the size of the screen that is being used.</p>
		<p>> Scratching head to figure out why the site displayed on my iPhone did not match the user-agent-spoofing on Chrome. First thought was an issue with the update to iOS 9.3.1 that I'd done earlier in the day, since the site was displaying as expected on an older iPhone without the newest update. However, tried clearing all the cookies and browsing data on Safari and it then worked! Made a slight tweak to the navitem click event to fade out the green background rather than keeping it set.</p>

		<h4>15 April 2016</h4>
		<p>> Thought of lots more things to add to the website "To Do" list: created additional issues for these in GitHub.</p>
		<p>> Modified the <a href="tictactoe.php">Tic Tac Toe</a> game to work on click events rather than dragging & dropping to make it more mobile-friendly.</p>
		<p>> Re-arranged the social buttons & top navigation on the header. Put the $page_title on the header. Changed the nav items on the top & left nav to use Bootstrap buttons, including playing around with additional CSS to get them displaying & positioned nicely.</p>
		<p>> Added Favicon.</p>
		<p>> Added site to Google Webmaster tools and spent a little time tinkering around with the settings & suggestions. Uploaded a sitemap. Will check on later to see how the site fairs on the reports.</p>

		<h4>14 April 2016</h4>
		<p>> Tweaked the CSS & JavaScript to ensure that the sections display as intended for both the Homepage and AstroPics.</p>
		<p>> Cropped/Resized all AstroPics images and used Bootstrap to control how these are viewed depending on screen size. For thumbnails, used jQuery to add a title attribute and a click event to open up a larger version of the image in a new window. Uses string manipulation from the source of the image that is clicked to determine the filename of the larger image to be shown, then queries the user's display resolution to create a window of the correct size to fit the screen. Quite pleased with that - seemed rather clever :)</p>
		<p>> Added a new page - <a href="animation.php">Animation</a> - to demonstrate some of the canvas manipulation that I've learned - drawing a couple of different shapes with various fill styles, and animating it.</p>

		<h4>13 April 2016</h4>
		<p>> Spent another huge chunk of time trying to get the #wrapper div [and corresponding gradient fill] to change dynamically. Accessing the heights of various properties e.g. div height, document height, window height, etc. For one reason or another, just can't get everything to work together. Settled for a solution, but not ideal as the div is always as tall as the section with most content, even if that section is hidden - which allows you can scroll into nothing. It'll do for now, spent far too much time on this already!!</p>
		<p>> Moved on to some work on the AstroPics page. Rather than displaying everything all at once, have broken this down into sections for a:) a more logical browsing experience; and b:) reducing load times.</p>

		<h4>12 April 2016</h4>
		<p>> Continuing to add more content to the "about me" section.</p>
		<p>> Structured the blog in a better way and added more detail.</p>
		<p>> Made a better job of the logic that sorts out the dynamic resizing of the background image as the window size is changed.</p>
		<p>> Spent a loooong time trying to work out how to get the #wrapper div to change dynamically correctly as the window is resized or different content is displayed, to ensure that the gradient fill displays as expected. Still a work in progress!</p>

		<h4>11 April 2016</h4>
		<p>> Working on the left nav on the homepage. Added additional sections to break down the "about me" blurb and used some CSS styling and jQuery effects to snazz it up a bit.</p>
		<p>> Adding more content to each of the "about me" sections.</p>

		<h4>10 April 2016</h4>
		<p>> Downloaded the jQuery and jQueryUI libraries to the site to allow use of these offline.</p>
		<p>> Realised I was duplicating a lot of &lt;head&gt; info in the php pages and the html content that is pulled from the require() function. Removed the duplication for hopefully a little performace benefit.</p>

		<h4>07 April 2016</h4>
		<p>> Had the power out for an electrical inspection for several hours so not a lot of progress today - just added some additional lines in the &lt;head&gt; for Bootstrap stuff. Tried to plan ahead for the outage by creating all the branches on Git and having various reference websites opened up so I could work offline on my local machine and just push the changes once the router was back up. One thing I didn't think of was that I am using Bootstrap and jQuery over CDNs, so as soon as I lost my Internet connexion the CSS on the website died :( #n00b</p>
		<p>> Spent my time doing some self studying instead - learning about the HTML5 canvas from my <a href="http://lpmj.net" target="_blank">Learning PHP, MySQL & JavaScript</a> book.</p>

		<h4>06 April 2016</h4>
		<p>> So much to do to get the site anywhere near how I'd like it! Decided to take a structured disciplined approach: broke everything down into "user stories" and raised these as issues on GitHub. For every issue I can create a separate branch from Master to make all the changes, then merge in to Master when I'm happy that the issue is complete.</p>
		<p>> Had the background set as a linear gradient, which is nice, but also liked the idea of also having a nice picture of the Andromeda galaxy [M31]. Decided to have both, and researched how to change the opacity of a background image.</p>
		<p>> Need to ensure that the background image looks good on all devices. Added some JavaScript to set the image an appropriate size depending on the initial viewport size, then change dynamically as the window is resized.</p>

		<h4>05 April 2016</h4>
		<p>> Added a couple more [mostly blank] html pages to put together a very basic shell to navigate around, including a header.</p>
		<p>> Incorporated Bootstrap & jQuery libraries to enhance the look/style of the site.</p>
		<p>> More content needed!</p>
		<p>> Repeating the header on every html page far from efficient: changed the pages to php and using require() to point to separate html files which contain the header and page content.</p>
		<p>> Site no longer loads... realised that the freebie site offered by Git only supports static content e.g. no support for PHP or any other dynamic content. Seems I'll have to upload changes to the site by FTP!! #retro</p>
		<p>> Still using Git for branches & version control.</p>
		<p>> Added a section to showcase some of the Astronomy Pics that I've taken over the years.</p>
		<p>> Added <a href="tictactoe.php">Tic Tac Toe</a> game to play.</p>
		<p>> Added Twitter widget to the header.</p>
