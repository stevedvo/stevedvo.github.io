<p>For as long as I can remember I have always looked up at the night sky in fascination and in admiration of it's beauty, and loved to see pictures of the planets, galaxies, and other celestial objects in magazines, encyclopaedias or on the telly.</p>
<p>There was one particular children's fact book on astronomy & space that I read over and over again, full of amazing and mind-blowing information [that was known at the time] regarding the size & scale of the planets, solar system, galaxy, and Universe - and I had a keen but casual interest in the subject of astronomy and the possibility of extra-terrestrial life throughout my childhood.</p>
<p>It was this early and ingrained interest that ultimately led me to study the topic at university. Some might argue of anything in the natural world that taking things apart, breaking things down, and making efforts to understand precisely how things work the way they do totally ruins the beauty of that thing. I could not disagree more! In my view, understanding the physical principles behind everything that is going on in the Universe that surrounds us only adds to the beauty and amazement - and astrophysics is certainly no exception. I consider myself fortunate to have a mind that works in a way that can cope with [and enjoys] solving mathematical & physical problems, working with calculus, and applying the learned laws of physics and scientific method to understand how things work. Planets, stars, galaxies, nebulae: they all become infinitely more fascinating the more they are studied.</p>
<p>University gave me a real appreciation and respect for the scientific method and the way that knowledge has been built up over time and continues to this day. I always try to keep this in mind when I read any articles I see on the Internet or anywhere: always question the validity - what are the sources? Are they credible? Always be objective and set aside your own beliefs / prejudices. Follow the evidence and be humble enough to allow your mind to be changed if the evidence is compelling.</p>
<p>One of my favourite experiences at university was a field trip to Tenerife to use one of the telescopes up in the El Teide National Park. We had a project to put together and submit a proposal to study a particular object, giving all the scientific reasons why the telescope time should be granted, what the optimal time & place would be to perform the observations, what was hoped to be learned, why it would be useful, etc, plus all of the calculations and uncertainty estimates to deduce how long the CCD camera would need to be exposed for to ensure good photometry. Then we flew out to Tenerife for a week or so, staying at the El Tope [I still remember the name!] in Puerto de la Cruz.</p>
<p>We were a group of astronomy students, so whereas everybody else was soaking up the sun we were effectively working a night-shift. Getting up and having dinner for breakfast, then making the journey up the winding mountain roads to the observatory to do the science. We had to take it in turns on the telescope to gather the data we each needed for our individual projects, so there was a lot of time waiting but this wasn't a problem since there was a whole beautiful night sky to look at!</p>
<p>Growing up in a village on the outskirts of Rotherham, the bottom third of the night sky always had that 589nm orange glow from the sodium streetlamps. I did not realise quite the impact that this was having on my early views of the night sky until I was 2,400m up that mountain in Tenerife. Beautifully clear skies, free of light pollution, I could see stars down to at least another 2-3 magnitudes. So. Many. Stars! I was in my early-20's and this was also the first time I'd ever actually seen the Milky Way with my own eyes. Absolutely incredible to see the faint band of our galaxy stretching from one side of the horizon to the other, and sadly something completely invisible due to the scourge of light-pollution in built-up areas.</p>
<p>Once our observations were complete there was the work involved to crunch through all the data and put together a proper scientific 'paper' fully describing the project, results & conclusions - which was also a great experience and worth the hard work involved. The field trip from start to finish was a fantastic experience and full of brilliant memories.</p>
<p>It was also whilst at university that I purchased my first telescope: an 8" Newtonian reflector on a Dobsonian mount. As mentioned above, the skies where I lived were unfortunately blighted by light-pollution, so any deep-sky observations were always going to be difficult - but the moon, planets, and even the sun [with a purchase of a full-aperture solar filter] were all fair game. Wow, wow, and WOW! You learn about these objects and see hundreds of pictures of them so you know what they look like, but to actually point a telescope and view these things in detail for yourself is a whole different ball game. The surface of the moon has soooooo many craters and features that you can see with the help of the optics. And the planets: amazing! They are REALLY there! You can point your telescope at these bright "wandering stars" and view them in real-time. With an 8" scope I can easily make out polar regions on Mars, the cloud bands on Jupiter, and the rings on Saturn. To see these things with my own eyes I think really helped me to feel a connexion with the cosmos, and served to further fuel my fascination with the subject and it's history. It was less than 400 years since Galileo first observed the planets in this way - can you imagine how incredible a discovery this was at the time, to be the first EVER human to witness the dancing of the Jovian moons around their host, and the strange "ears" of Saturn? Over time I added to my equipment with additional eyepieces and a Barlow lens for more magnification options, plus a digital camera and the necessary kit to attach it to the eyepieces and take some photographs.</p>
<p>Regrettably, these days I don't do anywhere near as much actual proper amateur astronomy as I ought to i.e. wrapping up warm to brave the cold night air, and looking up at the cosmos with either naked eye, binoculars, or telescope. But my interest in the subject has not waned - I still try to keep up to date as much as possible with the latest news, and look out for upcoming events that would be exciting to see or take photographs of. There are a number of links <a href="links.php#science_links">here</a> for various astronomy & general science websites that I visit often.</p>
