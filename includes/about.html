			<p>Spreadsheet, data and programming enthusiast.<p>
			<p>Having spent my teens in the 90's I have grown up with computers and followed with interest the advances in technology and the emergence of the Internet. Throughout my education and employment I have used a variety of platforms: from BBC Micros, Acorns & Atari STs through to various versions of Apple & Microsoft operating systems & environments.<p>
			<p>Studying Mathematics, Physics, Computing, and Astronomy at college and university gave me some excellent skills with regards to problem-solving, logical thinking, programming and the ability to accurately capture data and process it in an efficient and useful manner.<p>
			<p>Working for MoD contractors for 9+ years I have honed my skills in data-analysis: my main duties involving the exporting & merging job & accounts data from a variety of bespoke software applications into Excel and producing a number of daily/weekly/monthly/ad hoc reports to monitor operational & commercial performance. I always relished the opportunity to try something new, to think about how to break down the data in different ways to measure performance and how to utilise my generated reports to optimise business processes and maximise margins.</p>
			<p>I am self-studying to further my knowledge of HTML5, PHP, MySQL, JavaScript and CSS3 to open up new opportunities & challenges in web development and data & project management, and have put my skills to good use by joining DVO Media as Product Owner & Client Services Manager.</p>
			<p>Although I've been tinkering with web development for over a year, this is my first attempt at creating my own website.</p>
			<p>First things done:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Purchased a domain from 123-Reg</li>
				<li>Purchased hosting from 123-Reg</li>
				<li>Set up a new repo on my pre-existing Git account</li>
				<li>Figured out [I think] how to link my complimentary Git site to my registered domain</li>
				</ul>
			<p>Using Bootstrap and jQuery libraries to enhance the look/style of the site.</p>
			<p>Just need to add some content!</p>
			<p>Update: realised that the freebie site offered by Git does NOT support dynamic web pages. Did not fancy copying & pasting the header onto every page so uploading files to 123-Reg... by FTP!!! #retro
			<p>Added a section to showcase some of the Astronomy Pics that I've taken over the years.<p>
			<p>Added <a href="tictactoe.php">Tic Tac Toe</a> game to play.<p>
