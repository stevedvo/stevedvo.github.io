				<h3 class="head3">Who am I?</h3>
				<p>Steve DeVeaux BSc (Hons)</p>
				<p>Spreadsheet, data and programming enthusiast.<p>
				<p>Having spent my teens in the 90's I have grown up with computers and followed with interest the advances in technology and the emergence of the Internet. Throughout my education and employment I have used a variety of platforms: from the early days of BBC Micros, Acorns & Atari STs through to various versions of Apple & "IBM-Compatible" PCs. For my web development I am accustomed to using both Microsoft operating systems & environments as well as Apple OS X.<p>

				<h3 class="head3">Education</h3>
				<p>Studying Mathematics, Physics, Computing, and Astronomy in further & higher education gave me some excellent skills with regards to problem-solving, logical thinking, programming and the ability to accurately capture data and process it in an efficient and useful manner.<p>
				<p>The University of Sheffield</p>

				<h3 class="head3">Development</h3>
				<p>Working as a Commercial Manager with MoD contractors for 9+ years I have honed my skills in data-analysis: my main duties involving the exporting & merging job & accounts data from a variety of bespoke software applications into Excel and producing a number of daily/weekly/monthly/ad hoc reports to monitor operational & commercial performance. I always relished the opportunity to try something new, to think about how to break down the data in different ways to measure performance and how to utilise my generated reports to optimise business processes and maximise margins.</p>
				<p>Having left the contract I'd been working on for so long I was more than ready to face some new challenges and decided to concentrate my efforts on web development. The HTML I'd casually picked up whilst at school/college is a far cry from current technologies, and I am self-studying to improve my knowledge of - to begin with - HTML5, PHP, MySQL, JavaScript and CSS3. Putting my newfound knowledge together with my previous skills & experience I joined <a href="http://dvomedia.net">DVO Media</a> as Client Services Manager & Product Owner, where I gained valuable experience in Agile Software Development methodologies and development & task-management software:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Daily Scrum stand-up</li>
					<li>Backlog refinement</li>
					<li>Sprint planning and retrospective/review</li>
					<li>JIRA</li>
					<li>Trello</li>
					<li>Asana</li>
					<li>Xero</li>
					<li>Git & GitHub</li>
					<li>Sublime Text</li>
					<li>Slackware</li>
					<li>Bootstrap</li>
					<li>jQuery</li>
				</ul>
				<p>There was also ample opportunity to participate in additional events for the whole development team to further expand their knowledge and skills: attending monthly talks at a local php[Minds] group, regular team Dev Lunch / knowledge share sessions, and attending the 2016 PHPUK Conference in London.</p>
				<p>Although I've been tinkering with web development for over a year, this is my first attempt at creating my own website.</p>

				<h3 class="head3">Hobbies & Interests</h3>
				<p>Besides getting my head into web development and technology, I have several other hobbies & interests:<p>
				<p>Drumming</p>
				<p>Astronomy</p>
				<p>Photography</p>
				<p>Sci-fi</p>
				<p>Tom Clancy novels</p>
				<p>Baking</p>
				<p>Walking</p>

				<article class="temphdr"></article>
				<h3 class="head3">Blog</h3>
				<p>First things done:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Purchased a domain from 123-Reg</li>
					<li>Purchased hosting from 123-Reg</li>
					<li>Set up a new repo on my pre-existing Git account</li>
					<li>Figured out [I think] how to link my complimentary Git site to my registered domain</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Using Bootstrap and jQuery libraries to enhance the look/style of the site.</p>
				<p>Just need to add some content!</p>
				<p>Update: realised that the freebie site offered by Git does NOT support dynamic web pages. Did not fancy copying & pasting the header onto every page so uploading files to 123-Reg... by FTP!!! #retro
				<p>Added a section to showcase some of the Astronomy Pics that I've taken over the years.<p>
				<p>Added <a href="tictactoe.php">Tic Tac Toe</a> game to play.<p>
