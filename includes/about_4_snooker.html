<p>One of the few sports that I took a really keen interest in from quite a young age. Whilst at junior school I bought a small book on snooker which I read cover to cover several times. Published in 1986 [if I recall correctly], this was at a time when Steve Davis was at the top of his game and tv shows such as "Pot Black" were helping the sport to reach a wider audience.</p>
<p>The book explained everything there is to know about the game: origins, rules and variations, equipment, champions and notable players' profiles such as Davis, "Hurricane" Higgins, Jimmy White - also a page on up & coming players to watch out for which included quite prophetically a Scottish youngster by the name of Stephen Hendry!</p>
<p>It's a game I've always enjoyed watching and playing - although my skills at playing on an actual table are rather poor and I tend to have better success on computer games that help you to line the shots up! I find it brilliant to see how well the top players can control the cueball and place it in just the right place shot after shot to give themselves perfect position and build up a high break, but I also really enjoy the longer frames that require a great deal of skill in playing good safety shots and coming out on top of a great tactical battle.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is my slightly OCD personality that makes the game appeal to me: I like lots of games that involve "tidying up" or sorting things in some way. I like card games, for example, that end with the pack being left in order, and in snooker after the break-off the balls are placed in a random semi-chaotic fashion and which need tidying away into the pockets in a particular structured way - and the more points you can accrue whilst doing this the better.</p>
<p>It has been interesting in recent years to see the emergence of many more players from around the globe - particularly Asia - competing at the highest level, and the overall quality, long-pot success and break-building ability increase. The number of century breaks in the World Championship being a pretty good metric for how the quality has improved - either that or the pockets are becoming too easy to pot into! It can only be a matter of a few years before the first Asian World Champion is crowned in a game historically dominated by players of British/Commonwealth origins.</p>
