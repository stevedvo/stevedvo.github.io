	<h4>13 March 2017</h4>
	<p>> The last few days at work have mostly been tackling little issues/bugs/enhancements with either new or existing sites: some things fairly easy, some things taking a little time to wrap my head around and figure out. A particularly satisfying win today came in-between tasks as I was playing around with my Git / BitBucket settings.</p>
	<p>> In a nutshell, ever since I started work here I have always connected to our BitBucket repositories over HTTPS - which has meant that every time I do a 'git pull' or a 'git push' I have had to input my password for authentication. This gets really tiresome really quickly!</p>
	<p>> In the process of moving my website to different hosting [finally moving away from the pathetically slow 123-Reg hosting - yay!] I have been reading up a bit more about making an SSH terminal connexion, SSH private & public key pairs, etc. When I first started work here I tried to sort this out using the BitBucket tutorials but could never get it working right. Now, however, my bro has sent me <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/" target="_blank">a link</a> which explains everything much more clearly and I have successfully set my machine up to use the SSH keys and changed the remote URL to the SSH version. Now all the pulling & pushing with the remote is authenticated by the SSH keys and no more passwords required. Hurrah!</p>

	<h4>08 March 2017</h4>
	<p>> Have had my eye on local PHP groups for the last couple of weeks. I used to attend the occasional <a href="https://phpminds.org/" target="_blank">php[MiNDS]</a> talks when I worked with DVO Media, but haven't been to anything since I moved further south. Found a couple of local-ish groups that meet in Bristol and Reading, which aren't exactly on my doorstep but are close enough to home and work (respectively) to be feasible.</p>
	<p>> The Bristol talks [with <a href="http://phpsw.uk/" target="_blank">PHP South West</a>] were scheduled for this evening so I decided I'd better register with <a href="https://www.meetup.com/" target="_blank">meetup.com</a> and join the group so they can manage the numbers.</p>
	<p>> Just about made it on time after leaving work and driving the hour or so to Bristol to park up and find the place. The talks this evening were:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/Brunty/bdd-behat-72979884" target="_blank">Behaviour Driven Development</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/Brunty" target="_blank">Matt Brunt</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://slides.com/tomadam/remote-debugging-with-xdebug#/" target="_blank">Remote Debugging with XDebug</a> by Tom Adam</li>
	</ul>
	<p>> Both talks were very interesting, especially the first. The XDebug talk was a good refresher of some things that I learned whilst at DVO Media, however I have still yet to actually use it properly in my development - I still var_dump and exit - but I really ought to make use of this powerful tool.</p>

	<h4>07 March 2017</h4>
	<p>> Had a little bit of 'free' time today in-between projects, which I made good use of: set up a local WordPress instance to practice working with Advanced Custom Fields - specifically investigating how to make use of certain field types that I haven't used before/much: 'Gallery', 'Embed', 'Date/Time Picker', 'Flexible Content', 'Google Map'.</p>
	<p>> Spent a little while playing around with the Google Map field type - grabbed some code from the ACF documentation and used it to display a map on the front end with markers placed at specified places. The JavaScript calculates the map centre and zoom level based upon the markers specified. Also, using methods learned from another project, figured out how to give each of the markers a custom map pin icon.</p>
	<p>> Quite a nice useful couple of hours of self-teaching :)</p>
