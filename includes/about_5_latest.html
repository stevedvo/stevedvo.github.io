	<h4>22 July 2016</h4>
	<p>> Spent a few hours today continuing my quest for speed! Using the AJAX ideas on the index page as a template, I implemented the delayed loading of the below-the-fold content on the rest of my main pages. Mainly a copy & paste job with a number of page-specific adjustments in each case. Realised early on that some of the inline JavaScript was getting a bit repetitive so figured out a way to loop through some things for more efficient code.</p>
	<p>> On the laptop, all of the pages are now loading critical content in around 1,000ms - and as mentioned yesterday the next piece of the puzzle will be to pick apart the generously-sized jQuery and Bootstrap libraries so I'm only loading stuff that I actually really need.</p>
	<p>> The very high TTFB that I am getting when accessing the actual live site is quite a concern. It is very unpredictable: sometimes the TTFB can be 20s+, other times it can actually be fairly quick - with the index page-load time not far off my localhost server. I will still look further into is in the near future. I have to - there seems no point in trying to shave off an extra 200-300ms of load time through more efficient coding if the TTFB is 10x that!</p>

	<h4>21 July 2016</h4>
	<p>> Had a good day today working my way through everything on the homepage that is slowing down the page load time, studying and making sense of the network performance charts & info that Chrome provides. My homepage was taking the best part of 4 seconds to load [with cache disabled], even on my laptop which runs the localhost WAMP server!</p>
	<p>> The problem I had was that I was loading an awful lot of content that isn't displayed to the user initially i.e. "below-the-fold", which was holding up the rendering of all the "above-the-fold" content that the user DOES want to see ASAP. Did a lot of reading on 'preload', 'prefetch', and 'prerender' link relations and asynchronous JavaScript calls.</p>
	<p>> Since a lot of my pages are self-contained with the dynamic jQuery tabs & selectmenu structures I had to figure out a way of keeping everything on the same physical page without too large an overhead on the initial load. After a little playing I eventually reached a solution whereby all the below-the-fold content is pulled in by AJAX, and only AFTER the above-the-fold has already loaded. I have also implemented prerender to cache a number of other pages within my site for faster access - and again, only doing this once the above-the-fold content has already been loaded. And I inserted a bunch of JavaScript in the &lt;head&gt; section of the index page rather than linking to a external file, which goes against what I learned about HTML5 methodology but seems to be the way forward in terms of faster page-loading.</p>
	<p>> The result: I have managed to trim a healthy 70% of the index page-load time. Very happy with this! Now loading in a little over a second on the local server. My next step is to implement these ideas into the other pages [although since they have less content the rewards will not be so great] and then look further at how I can get this trimmed down even more. The main bottlenecks now I believe are in loading the relatively large Bootstrap & jQuery libraries - of which I'm only actually using a very small fraction on each page. If I can take out just the parts that are relevant for each page and put this code in the &lt;head&gt; section I expect I will see some benefit.</p>
	<p>> Another mahoosive bottleneck also seems to be the server response time. Seriously, sometimes I can open up my site and be waiting over 20 seconds for the Time To First Byte [TTFB]. Absolutely awful! But once the server bites, my page is now loading up quicker than before... and thanks to the 'prerender' code the rest of the pages get cached in the background for quicker access too [on Chrome, at least]. Maybe I need to get my head into server configurations to see what I can do about this frankly abysmal TTFB - perhaps I just need a better provider?</p>

	<h4>19 July 2016</h4>
	<p>> Not made many changes to the website in the last few weeks - busy with other stuff. Been thinking I really ought to get on with another Blog update - SO much stuff going on in the world: the Conservative leadership contest has already come to an end and we already have a new PM - wowzers!; terrorist attacks in Nice, France; more black citizens killed by police in the US, and backlashes/protests resulting in police officers being targeted & killed; the Trident nuclear defence system being given the thumbs-up for continuation. So much news, so little time! Perhaps in the future I'll come back to some of this and share my thoughts when I have a little more time!</p>
	<p>> Have been reading recently about "Accelerated Mobile Pages" and I am keen to implement at least some of these ideas into my website to speed up the load times on all platforms. Made the first little tweak to the main PHP docs for each page to set the page title and pull through the other content a little better.</p>
	<p>> Removed the "Euro 2016" link from the Links page, and replaced with "World Cup 2018".</p>

	<p>> In the quest to chase down things which may be slowing down page loads, I have been investigating an issue whereby I keep getting console error messages when loading the homepage in Chrome, which has been happening ever since I embedded a couple of youTube videos in my Blog. Had a look-see if there was anything I could do to stop this from happening - naturally I assumed that it was something that I'd gotten wrong in my embed code somehow. But looking into it I found <a href="https://code.google.com/p/google-cast-sdk/issues/detail?id=538" target="_blank">this</a> article, which explains that this is actually an issue with Google ChromeCast, and the devs are working to Blacklist these sorts of errors from appearing in the console. Many of these have been blacklisted already, but the couple that I am seeing will be resolved with the release of Chrome v52 - estimated 26 July. So I'll re-check in a week!</p>
	<p>> It's been a hot day - the temperature in the office has crept above 30 degrees! My laptop was feeling very hot this afternoon! Curious to see what the actual temperatures were, I installed <a href="http://www.piriform.com/speccy" target="_blank">Speccy</a>, a neat little tool from Piriform - the company that made CCleaner and Defraggler which are another two very useful apps for PC health. Anyhoo, the tool confirmed that the laptop temperatures were very hot indeed - especially the CPU which is running constantly at full tilt crunching BOINC workunits. The hard drive was registering in the red at 56 degrees!!</p>
	<p>> Remembering a cool trick I saw on a recent Facebook post, I placed several stacks of copper coins on/under the really hot parts of the laptop - which helps to draw heat out of the laptop since copper is a better conductor of heat than air is. It did work - bringing the HD temp down to 52 degrees. But then rather than continuing to decrease it began to creep up again - the coins had gotten too hot themselves. So the next thing I tried was to put the laptop on a granite kitchen workboard, which worked very well - a lot more material to disperse the excess heat. Got the HD temp down to 46 degrees before even that started to warm up a little too much. The heat tends to be concentrated more to one side than the other, so I can keep rotating the board to maintain this extra heatsink effect!</p>

	<h4>04 July 2016</h4>
	<p>> Went to the cinema at the weekend to see "Independence Day: Resurgence". Thought it would be a good idea to start a 'Movie Reviews' section on my site. Have posted a review under 'Interests'/'Cinema' for now, but I may create a new, more easily-accessible section for movie reviews as & when this grows. Enjoy.</p>
