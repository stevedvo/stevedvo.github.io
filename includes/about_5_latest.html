	<h4>14 September 2016</h4>
	<p>> Added the content for the last page on my <a href="/bfb">practice WordPress site</a>, including any necessary CSS tweaks and playing around with images to ensure it looks good on various screen widths.</p>
	<p>> Checked all of the pages on my iPhone to confirm that they look the same as the equivalent width on the desktop computer. Found a few differences, and played about with the CSS to sort out a couple of issues.</p>
	<p>> Returned back to the Reviews page to try and understand how the plugin works & displays everything correctly on the 'twentyfourteen' theme but not on mine! Delved into the PHP behind it all but couldn't quite put my finger on it with the time that I had. Added in the rest of the reviews / comments / photos just to get everything on the DB, but it is still not displaying as I'd like on my theme. Annoying.</p>

	<h4>13 September 2016</h4>
	<p>> Spent another good portion of the day working on my recent practice <a href="/bfb">live WordPress site</a>. After the homepage was pretty much sorted last week, I worked through the other pages on the site. A little more time needed here than I envisioned to tweak the CSS for the individual pages to look good. It looked OK with the basic template but I wanted to fine-tune the positioning of elements on each page and for each screen width, so that needed a fair bit of page-specific CSS creating.</p>
	<p>> It also didn't help that in the process of creating pages for a contact form and a reviews section I downloaded & installed a couple of plugins. A clean WordPress install is just about bearable on this 123-Reg server, but it seems each additional plugin adds around 30 seconds to the page loading time! Both in the back-end when trying to update stuff, and the front-end when trying to simply view the pages. I am certain I could have made significantly more progress had I not spent so long just waiting for pages to load! So again, quite frustrating.</p>
	<p>> I have one more simple page to create, and I need to spend more time tinkering with the Reviews page. On my own theme the formatting looks quite rubbish and it generates a console error, but on a pre-prepared theme (e.g. "twentyfourteen") it looks and works much better - so I need to understand what the differences are either in the PHP code, CSS, or both.</p>

	<h4>09 September 2016</h4>
	<p>> Too busy yesterday with other errands & stuff to do anything in the way of studying / website work, but was able to get back on it for a few hours today. Have been working on the <a href="/bfb">live WordPress site</a> that I created a couple of days ago - my main focus today has been in configuring all the CSS to work responsively so that the homepage looks good on mobile and other devices. So very nearly there before my time ran out and I had other time-sensitive jobs to do. Just have a couple of tweaks for a couple of breakpoints to sort out and then the homepage is sorted - and once the theme is configured correctly for that the rest of the pages should fall nicely into place. There will be a few minor page-specific tweaks required, and then sorting out a more interactive page for user comments / reviews, but I'm making good progress.</p>

	<h4>07 September 2016</h4>
	<p>> Had a good day today getting my head into some of the inner workings of WordPress. Creating my own theme for a specific website, and using a known good theme to understand how to access certain elements within the pages. Starting off with a fairly simple theme but once done I can build on this and create more complicated ones.</p>
	<p>> Managed to get my live WordPress install working at a more reasonable speed by deactivating a bunch of the plugins that I'd gradually installed as I'd been working through the "WordPress In Easy Steps" book. Could still do with a kick up the arse but it's back to something at least workable.</p>

	<h4>06 September 2016</h4>
	<p>> Spent another few hours working through my "WordPress In Easy Steps" book, and actually managed to get to the end of it already! The chapters covered in the last half of the book are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Settings & Tools</li>
		<li>SEO & Social Media</li>
		<ul>
			<li>WordPress SEO by Yoast (plugin)</li>
			<li>Social Media Buttons</li>
			<li>Twitter Feed</li>
			<li>Instagram Photos</li>
		</ul>
		<li>User Interaction</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Comments</li>
			<li>Spam Control</li>
			<li>Forums</li>
			<li>Contact Forms</li>
			<li>Translation</li>
			<li>Membership Levels</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Tips & Tricks</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Google Analytics</li>
			<li>Google Maps</li>
			<li>Newsletter Forms</li>
			<li>Sitemaps</li>
			<li>Google Fonts</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Advanced WordPress</li>
		<ul>
			<li>WordPress & PHP</li>
			<li>Setting Up FTP</li>
			<li>Creating A Theme</li>
			<li>WordPress Backup</li>
			<li>Responsive Design</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<p>> Almost all of the chapters basically involved downloading some sort of plugin, maybe signing up to some sort of service to get an API key, and covering how to configure various settings with each chosen plugin - most of which were fairly obvious in any case. Whilst it was good to have this available as a reference, I have to say this left me feeling rather disappointed. There was only really the last chapter that seemed to have some good meaty content about how to interact with the backend but it was only briefly touched upon and doesn't go into great depth/detail.</p>
	<p>> I got fed up of trying to do anything on my live 123-Reg server since it was mind-numbingly slow, so I did what I could on my local WAMP server - which was a bit limiting in terms of the services that I could sign up with and get API keys for.</p>
	<p>> I can see that the book IS a very useful guide/resource for the layperson wanting to understand the basics of WordPress to set up their own website, and is good for pointing out particular good plugins for achieving various tasks depending on what you might want to use the website for... but I was hoping for more technical stuff to understand how to interact with WordPress and do more theme creation / tweaking - perhaps even creating my own plugins. I expect there are other books / online resources available that will help me get up to this level.</p>

	<h4>05 September 2016</h4>
	<p>> Had a very good few hours today working through my "WordPress In Easy Steps" book. Actually not an awful lot covered so far that I hadn't already figured out after a bit of playing around with it, but it covers a few useful plugins. The chapters I've looked at so far cover the following topics:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Introduction to WordPress</li>
		<li>Dashboard & Users</li>
		<li>Appearance & Themes</li>
		<li>Creating Content:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Pages</li>
			<li>Posts</li>
			<li>Adding audio, images, video</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Plugins</li>
		<li>Creating An Online Store (WooCommerce)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>> I'm certain 123-Reg is getting s-l-o-w-e-r by the day! Trying to update my WordPress site today was taking far too long - sometimes waiting well over a entire minute to load a page - absolutely ridiculous!! Would have gotten considerably more work done if I wasn't waiting for it to load for so long. Used the waiting time to read up about Amazon Web Services - I think it would be worthwhile ditching 123-Reg before the 12-months is up and getting hosting from elsewhere.</p>

	<h4>01 September 2016</h4>
	<p>> My "WordPress In Easy Steps" book arrived this afternoon - woohoo! :D</p>
	<p>> Unfortunately had quite a few other things on today. Had a quick flick through the book but not properly sat down and made a start on it, and tomorrow I won't have a lot of time either - but I should be able to crack on on Monday when things are back to normal [school holidays over, etc].</p>
