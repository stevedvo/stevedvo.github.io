	<h4>20 December 2016</h4>
	<p>> Got into work early this morning, and continued the effort to try and get a really old version of PHP set up on a dev environment to test the changes that had been made for the Yacht Marina site. After not really making much progress, and considering the early hour and our confidence that the fixes would actually work as intended, we decided to put the changes live - and it worked. Hurrah! Ever so annoying having to work to such an early PHP version but there have definitely been lessons learned, here!</p>

	<h4>19 December 2016</h4>
	<p>> Had confirmation today that the changes I'd made to the Yacht Marina site a little while ago were OK to go live. I thought I was so well prepared: I'd made detailed notes of which files needed to be replaced, I made backups of things, I'd ensured the BitBucket repos were in order. What I did not give any consideration for was the PHP version that the site was running on, and holy cow it was old!! Version 5.3.3, which was released in 2010 and has been effectively obsolete since August 2014! The PHP was so old that the '[]' array declarations I was using were not recognised, and neither was the http_response_code() function that I was making use of for some of the redirects, or the $_SERVER['REQUEST_SCHEME'] array element.</p>
	<p>> Due to the number of issues encountered, I set about trying to find a way of setting up a dev environment that actually matched what the live environment was - so that I could be sure that the fixes I needed to apply would actually work, but trying to find a PHP version that old was proving rather tricky! The earliest I could find was v5.3.29 but WAMP wasn't happy - I think the Apache version is too recent to be compatible. #FML</p>

	<p>> Had my first proper taste of MailChimp today! Had a task which was to put together an e-mail for a campaign that the client was running. It seems all very old-hat putting these mail templates together with nested tables! Good experience, though, especially in understanding how different e-mail clients then render these e-mails. Of course, Microsoft takes the prize again for the worst implementation: Outlook is absolutely dreadful!! Basically everything works on every e-mail client EXCEPT for Outlook, so you have to re-code lots of things especially for it. Awesome.</p>
	<p>> Finally got the go-ahead this week to perform the Joomla upgrade on the site I was working on last month, and we chose to do this in the late afternoon / early evening slot when site traffic was typically at a low point. We actually tried this yesterday but encountered all sorts of issues - again most likely related to the same problem with the permissions settings that has blighted much of the work done on this site since we started work on it. We have previously resolved these issues by setting permissions of certain files & folders to 777, but doing this in FileZilla takes an awfully long time. Didn't take much Googling to find the appropriate commands to punch into the PuTTY console and this I found was a MUCH quicker way of setting the perms. With the perms set at 777 we were able to perform the upgrade VERY easily indeed, and then quickly set the files & folders back to the more secure 644 and 755 as they should be.</p>
	<p>> This problem with the permissions has always irked me: it really shouldn't be necessary to keep messing about like this, and today I finally found the proper solution for it which I am ever so pleased about! For somebody more familiar with unix this may have been a bit of a no-brainer all along, but on a hunch I wondered if the issue was due not to the permissions but the file OWNERSHIP. I noticed that every file & folder on the Droplet had an ownership/group of root/root... everything EXCEPT for the PDF files that are generated by the site as users create transactions, which are www-data/www-data. To enable these PDF files to be saved, the containing folder had to have permissions set to 777. So my thought process was 'what if the ownership of the containing folder was set to www-data itself' - and then by extension, the whole site! Found the 'chown' command and the syntax required to run this recursively, and the site works exactly as it should now without compromising the security by setting stuff to 777. Very happy about this - and I expect the Joomla update would have worked without any problems if I'd done this beforehand!</p>

	<p>> Spent most of the work-day helping out others with their projects: one was to set up a Digital Ocean Droplet with the correct versions of Ubuntu, PHP, and MySQL to allow a Laravel site to be set up on it. Encountered various issues when trying to do this: either the SQL import failing due to version incompatibility, or issues with the site routing, or all sorts of other things. Certainly not as straight-forward as I thought it would be - and we must have created & destroyed at least 3 Droplets in the process! - but good to get a little insight into Laravel.</p>
	<p>> Spent some time troubleshooting some issues with getting a site working properly with BitBucket. The site is being developed using nodeJS, gulp, SCSS, TypeScript, and when trying to clone the repo to work collaboratively on it many of the files fail the 'pull' due to overly-long filepaths/names. Found a git command that would get overcome this problem, but then still had issues with getting the repo down properly. It transpired that there was a nested repo which wasn't helping matters! We eventually ironed-out all the issues and got the repo in a fit state for development.</p>

	<p>> Had a pretty good evening working on my home Shopping List app. It now functions to add items to the shopping list by way of a jQuery-UI Autocomplete [I'm quite happy with the spaghetti code I put together for that to get the PHP & JS working together to dynamically re-build the list of available items each time], allow the items to be updated / removed, and if trying to add an item to the list that is not in the DB then I figured out I could use the $_SESSION array to pass data via a PHP redirect to the 'add-to-db' page with some of the form pre-completed. A lot of time this afternoon was spent on making the homepage more mobile-responsive i.e. using &lt;div&gt;s with appropriate classes & styles rather than a &lt;table&gt;. All good fun :)</p>
	<p>> Have been having issues with my iPhone recently: it would do an emergency shutdown as if the battery was almost dead, but the battery level was actually reporting it was barely below 20%. Googled this to see if it was a common fault, and I learned that now & then the iPhone may need a 'battery recalibration'. Looked up step-by-step instructions on how to do this, and after leaving the phone to fully charge for 5 hours or so whilst turned off, and resetting it, it seems to be reporting the battery status better: the level is already decreasing from 100% rather than it staying there for several hours as it did on Thursday/Friday. Early days, but hopefully fixed!</p>

	<h4>08 December 2016</h4>
	<p>> Discovered something new that is irritating about IE today! Had been tasked with sorting out some issues on a site that uses a 3D 'flip' effect when you click/hover on certain elements of the page, with the reverse side of the element showing some different content to the front side. The CSS code behind this works fine on Chrome and Firefox, but on IE the back side of the element shows the inverted front side!</p>
	<p>> Did a lot of reading and research on 3D transforms and transitions, and it appears that IE does not support the particular attribute: value "transform-style: preserve-3d" which seemed to be the main cause. Tried numerous workarounds but none of them perfect and most ended up making the effect look a bit crap on all platforms. Found a solution which made IE slightly better without wrecking the rest of the browsers so went with that. Not perfect, not 100% happy, but spent waaaaaay too long on it!</p>
	<p>> After that I actually got to put a website live for the first time! A project I've dipped in & out of since I started had finally got the green light. With the FTP login and hosting details I took a backup of the existing site. Was going to back up the DB too but it wasn't in use - existing site obvs not dynamic. Uploaded the WordPress site, created a DB, amended the wpconfig with the DB credentials, and it didn't work :(. Just kept hitting a DB connexion error. Realised after a bit of trial & error that the DB user had not been set up with sufficient permissions. Once I'd selected all it worked like a charm. Needed a few tweaks to the site to sort out minor issues in the live environment but that didn't take long.</p>
	<p>> Bit of BitBucket repo housekeeping - merged my first branch back into master, figuring out how to do that on the website and locally through the command line.</p>

	<p>> Had a useful hour or so during breakfast making a start on a home project: a little local PHP shopping list site. Created a DB in phpMySql, and added a couple of tables after thinking a bit about the table structure that I'd need. Sorted out a DB initialisation file and an index page just to test the connexion and output something. All good so far - not a bad result for just an hours work.</p>

	<h4>06 December 2016</h4>
	<p>> Have been working on a new project the last couple of days, making some updates for a Yacht Marina site. As always when working on an existing site, one of the first things to do is take a complete copy of all the site files and the database and get a local dev environment set up - but this particular site was being a real pain! All sorts of issues with the .htaccess configuration that was copied over, and the way that certain plug-ins had been set up. Lots of things to have to disable or reconfigure to get anywhere with it. This was very far from being a simple job just to get the back- and front-ends working.</p>
	<p>> But once I'd gotten the dev environment set up, this is an interesting new little project for me to work on: involving manipulating data that is fetched from a 3rd-party API to build URL strings and display pages that are dynamically generated depending on what the API returns; understanding how to use WordPress rewrite rules in combination with regular expressions; understanding how to put together a sitemap which is generated dynamically - depending on which pages would exist based on the data retrieved from the API; and figuring out a function to disable Yoast's default behaviour on certain pages where the canonical link needs tweaking.</p>
