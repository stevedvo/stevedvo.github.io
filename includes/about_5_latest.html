	<h4>16 August 2016</h4>
	<p>> Busy morning working on other things, but had a few hours today to make a start on WebDev Unit 5. This Unit is concerned with the principles of Internet security, and the topics covered today included:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Encryption of wireless networks:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)</li>
			<li>Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA)</li>
			<li>WPA2</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Methods of online protection:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Authentication</li>
			<li>Digital Certificates</li>
			<li>Encryption</li>
			<li>Firewalls</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Identifying how encryption helps ensure that certain user-end transactions are secure, pertaining in particular to:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Data confidentiality</li>
			<li>Data integrity</li>
			<li>Non-repudiation</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Describing what a computer virus is, what it does, how it can spread, and what methods a user can employ to minimise their exposure to them.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>> Also today I was having a little nosey around at the 123-Reg hosting extras / features. In particular I was interested in what website building tools and content management systems I had at my disposal. I would have to upgrade my plan to get access to WordPress, but there is a useful looking tool that I could use whereby I can choose a theme and customise it to my needs. Will probably be worthwhile having a play with that and seeing what I can do with it, just for the experience - and to then inspect all of the CSS & stuff to see if I can learn any new tricks :D</p>

	<h4>15 August 2016</h4>
	<p>> Good day catching up with where I wanted to be on my WebDev course - completed the assignment questions for Unit 4. Again, quite an interesting few topics covered which helped to fill some gaps in my technical knowledge:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Understanding the uses and underlying technology of RSS/Atom feeds</li>
		<li>Understanding the function and hierarchical structure of the Domain Name System</li>
		<li>Describing IPv4 and IPv6</li>
		<li>Defining shared domains</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>12 August 2016</h4>
	<p>> Again not had a great deal of time to do much of my WebDev course - only managed to get through a few more topics on Unit 4:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Explaining the purpose of:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Remote Access Protocols</li>
			<li>Point-to-Point Protocols</li>
			<li>Point-to-Point Protocols over Ethernet</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Identify different types of Internet bandwidth technologies:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Ethernet (802.3)</li>
			<li>Wireless / Wi-Fi (802.11)</li>
			<li>Copper & Fibre Optic cabling</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Describe how to map protocols to specific business services e.g. POP vs IMAP, TCP vs UDP</li>
	</ul>
	<p>> Some interesting topics covered. But by having a couple of busy days with other things and therefore not completing Unit 4 today I am now a little behind schedule! Plus I still haven't done the 10 minute Webcast needed to complete Unit 2. Must crack on with it next week!</p>
	<p>> I was having a little play about with some CSS today, and rediscovered a couple of very useful features: the flexbox and transitions. I MUST have covered these well over a year ago when I first worked my way through my "CSS3 In Easy Steps" book, but these particular features had completely fallen out of my brain amongst all the other new things I was learning with HTML5, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, etc! Sooo much to learn it is no surprise that some things were not retained. Might be an idea to go through this [and possibly other books] again to refill in some gaps. So much to do, so little time! :(</p>

	<h4>11 August 2016</h4>
	<p>> Not had a lot of time for either website fettling or WebDev course today, but I did read through and complete one assessment question on:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Weighing up the benefits & drawbacks of cloud computing</li>
	</ul>
	<p>> That is all. Oh, and moved the July blog posts out of the "latest" category.</p>

	<h4>10 August 2016</h4>
	<p>> Spent some more time today on my WebDev course, completing the last couple of Unit 3 assessment questions before moving on to Unit 4. The final questions on Unit 3 covered:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Concerns/issues with using Web-based or IMAP-based e-mail setups</li>
		<li>Comparing the pros & cons of using e-mails Vs text messaging in a business context</li>
	</ul>
	<p>> Unit 4 focuses on "Understanding Internet Architecture". First impressions from the topics covered today are that this unit is very wordy - a lot of information to take in, rather than demonstrating practical skills. But it's an interesting topic and helping to fill in several gaps so I'm quite enjoying this one so far. The topics I've looked at today are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Distinguishing between SERVERS and</li>
		<ul>
			<li>THIN Clients</li>
			<li>THICK Clients</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Understanding what protocols are and their use for the Internet e.g. HTTP, TCP, UDP, IP</li>
		<li>Explaining the infrastructure required to support an Internet client, including basic hardware and software</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>09 August 2016</h4>
	<p>> Had an e-mail through from 123-Reg this morning regarding my support ticket asking about how to configure the IIS server to ensure it is always serving gzip-compressed versions where possible. It was pretty useless:</p>
	<p>> "coding related issues fall out of our area of expertise. If the code that you have added for gzip compression..." [i.e. THE CODE GIVEN ON THEIR WEBSITE] "...does not work, please search for another one and then test it."</p>
	<p>> Wow, gee, thanks for all your help! Not like I didn't think of that already and spend several hours trying to fix it myself before contacting you. Gah!!!</p>
	<p>> Didn't really do any more with my website today anyway, I've been back on the WebDev course. Started Unit 3 today, which is concerned with "Configuring an e-mail client to send and receive e-mail in a workplace context". Piece of cake. The first assignment question was to demonstrate that I knew how to set up an e-mail client. As it happened, I received the free laptop that comes with the course yesterday, which was useful as I could put a fresh install of Office on it and screenshot each step of the process that I go through in configuring Outlook to the correct IMAP and SMTP servers. Other topics covered included:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Understanding MIME, S/MIME, PGP and GPG - some new knowledge for me there which was good</li>
		<li>Demonstrate how to create an e-mail signature and understand why this is useful in a business context</li>
		<li>Understand e-mail threads, replying, reply-all-ing, forwarding, CC-ing, BCC-ing</li>
		<li>How to filter spam</li>
		<li>Advantages of, and issues with business e-mail</li>
		<li>How to set up auto-replies / out of office messages</li>
		<li>How to add e-mail attachments</li>
	</ul>
	<p>> All pretty basic stuff, but as with the earlier Units still time-consuming to read through all the material and actually answer the questions with the requisite level of detail and screenshots where appropriate. Have a couple more questions to answer on this Unit then it's another one ready to submit... although I can't actually submit it yet since I still have the Webcast from Unit 2 to do and I can't submit Unit(n+1) until Unit(n) has been submitted, moderated, and granted an overall pass.</p>
	<p>> I am beginning to get a little bit irritated at the number of obvious spelling and grammatical errors that are actually in the course content. They lay it on thick about ensuring that when communicating in a business context you have to be very careful with your spelling & grammar, and then make a large number of errors themselves! I have started using the 'social' feature to highlight these errors as I come across them, and posting the corrections. There are occasional little hangman and wordsearch games to break up the course as you go through the material. One of the wordsearches had the word "protcol" to find, so I was like do I actually look for the mis-spelled word or will it be in the grid as "protocol"? Turns out it was in the letter grid mis-spelled. Unbelievable! It's kind of amusing, really, but considering the cost of the course I'd have thought they would have done some decent proof-reading, otherwise it kinda brings the whole integrity into question!</p>

	<h4>08 August 2016</h4>
	<p>> Having a look through Google's PageSpeed Insights on the WebMaster tools today to see how I can try to speed up my website loading time.</p>
	<p>> Been investigating the "Leverage Browser Caching" suggestion, and looking up how to modify the web.config and .htaccess files to put this into effect. After some minor changes the PageSpeed Insights are showing slightly improved speed and this item is now checked off the list.</p>
	<p>> The next item that PageSpeed is advising about is enabling compression. I thought a few months ago that this had been resolved by adding a bunch of &lt;httpCompression&gt; code to the web.config file but obviously not! Spent several hours researching this trying to figure out what else I need to do to get this working. It wasn't compressing the pages on the localserver either. The actual localhost fix was quite simple once I'd spent time trying to find the solution - since I am running an Apache server I found an option to enable zlib output compression in the PHP settings.</p>
	<p>> But no matter what I tried with the web.config file, I could not get the remote IIS server to give me the compressed version - as evidenced on the Dev Tools: the size/content values are the same, and there is no "Content-Encoding: gzip" line in the response headers.</p>
	<p>> Had a brief online chat with 123-Reg support to explain the problem, but due to the technical nature of it they have raised a support ticket rather than being able to look into straight away. I did find after that that when I request an .html file, the response DOES come back with gzip encoding. Perhaps there is some issue with the Dynamic configuration that is not apparent for Static content? Shall await a response from 123-Reg before spending any more time on this!</p>
	<p>> Next issue: Optimise images. A few images on the header were larger than they needed to be, but the main issue was picked up on the "Links" page - which was no surprise since it was full of screenshots in .png format! Reduced the size of each image down to something similar to the largest that it needs to be [depending on the screensize], and saved as .jpg files. This has taken loads of time off the page-loading time, but PageSpeed Insights is still not happy and thinks there is more to be done - it mainly saying now that the images could be losslessly compressed to reduce the sizes by another two-thirds!</p>
	<p>> Converted all of the .jpg files to .tif to take advantage of the LZW compression... but found that .tif images actually do not display on Chrome, so changed those back - d'oh!! Not sure how to implement a lossless compression then as PageSpeed is suggesting... more research needed!</p>

	<h4>05 August 2016</h4>
	<p>> Completed my assessment for WebDev Unit 2 today... well, almost. Continuing with the communication theme, the topics studied today included:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>VoIP</li>
		<li>social networking</li>
		<li>WEB2.0</li>
		<li>mashups</li>
		<li>blogging</li>
		<li>news feeds</li>
		<li>folksonomies</li>
		<li>webcasts & webinars Vs face-to-face meetings</li>
		<li>how to present technical info to a non-technical audience</li>
		<li>what expenses you can claim as an IT professional</li>
	</ul>
	<p>> Again, some interesting topics to help broaden my knowledge... but a section on expenses?!</p>
	<p>> Have left one assessment question for now... I need to prepare and present a 10 minute webcast on a subject of my choice. It won't actually be a real one that is broadcast live but I need to demonstrate that I understand the principles of how to actually create one and make it interesting for the audience. Rather lacking in enthusiasm for creating a video of myself! Cringe! And no idea what subject I could base it on that I could jabber on about for 10 mins, will give it some thought over the weekend...</p>
	<p>> Had my first results returned this afternoon: all questions and hence the unit passed. Woohoo! 1 down, 21 to go.</p>

	<h4>04 August 2016</h4>
	<p>> Made a start today on Unit 2 of my WebDev course. Was hoping to get further with it than I actually did - my plans were scuppered by a town-wide power-cut this afternoon which lasted the best part of 2 hours! I still intend to finish this unit tomorrow, though - so I'll just have to crack on even more to keep to my schedule.</p>
	<p>> Of the Unit that I did read through and do the assessments on, it was very much more of the hard slog on simple stuff: this unit is mainly (so far) involved with using the Internet as form of communication, and part of the assessment is in demonstrating the ability to communicate over e-mail effectively - and I had to draft 3 separate e-mails to the local council, the local PCC, and my MP asking for information relating to cybercrime!</p>
	<p>> I kind of understand the point of it - to get a well-rounded view of things and demonstrate key skills, but this is very much not what I had in mind for a course that is entitled "Web Design and Development". I am sure the more relevant and interesting topics will come soon enough once I've got this basic stuff done. Getting to the end of this course will be a masterclass in patience as much as anything else! Just got to focus on the end goal.</p>

	<h4>02 August 2016</h4>
	<p>> Spent a large part of the day continuing with Unit 1 of my WebDev course. I'd read through all the material yesterday and just had the assessment to do. Despite much of this being previous knowledge, the assessments are still taking a very long time to wade through - many of the questions requiring a couple of hundred words of explanations, and in being able to demonstrate I can do certain things (like install a web browser, open & switch between browsers/windows/tabs, navigate hyperlinks, etc) I need to take loads of screenshots to show what I am doing on the screen and then upload them to my answer. It's all simple stuff but ever so time-consuming!</p>
	<p>> It seemed like a very long day, and was glad to complete the assessment and get it submitted. It's the first one, and will take a few days to come back from the assessor with a mark, but all being well I should find that I have answered the questions correctly and with a sufficient level of detail.</p>
	<p>> Whilst I was faffing about with different browsers, I pointed the latest version of Firefox at my website and realised that the gradient fill is not displaying in the same way that it does on Chrome, IE, and Safari - it is pushed out to the right of the main body rather than being overlaid on top of it. A single line to specify the position soon sorted it.</p>

	<h4>01 August 2016</h4>
	<p>> Today I started work on a new course that I've signed up for: it is to gain a certificate in <a href="https://www.innovateawarding.org/qualifications/qualifications-list/it/certificate-in-web-design-and-development-rqf/" target="_blank">Web Design and Development</a> and I am hopeful that the new qualification will help me in my web development career. Although I have some professional experience with development, and I am learning more and more all the time with my own studies and experiments with creating, maintaining, and improving this website, one thing I do lack is an actual proper qualification in the field. It's one thing knowing that I can do certain things, it's another thing being able to convince any potential employers!</p>
	<p>> The course is being offered by <a href="http://thetrainingroom.com" target="_blank">The Training Room</a>, and included in their fees is 3 years of career support to help students and graduates get into work during/following the course and to be on hand in the early years of career progression and development.</p>
	<p>> The first few modules of the course that I have looked at so far have mainly been in establishing "soft skills" that are required in general for any sort of employment; establishing my level of maths, English, logical reasoning; psychometric testing; advice on how to apply for jobs, and interview tips.</p>
	<p>> Also made a start on some of the meatier stuff of the course. Aimed at beginners, it begins with a lot of introductory stuff about various types of networks, explaining some simple terms and ideas, and delves a little into security aspects. Much of this I already knew about, but it was good to actually do some proper reading and formal learning on the subject to cover areas about which I wasn't quite so knowledgeable.</p>
	<p>> There are a few more modules which cover all the basics before the modules that cover the actual coding, but once I get to the coding my intention is to use this site to upload all the assignments that the course covers and have a copy of my online portfolio here for easy viewing.</p>
