	<h4>19 July 2016</h4>
	<p>> Not made many changes to the website in the last few weeks - busy with other stuff. Been thinking I really ought to get on with another Blog update - SO much stuff going on in the world: the Conservative leadership contest has already come to an end and we already have a new PM - wowzers!; terrorist attacks in Nice, France; more black citizens killed by police in the US, and backlashes/protests resulting in police officers being targeted & killed; the Trident nuclear defence system being given the thumbs-up for continuation. So much news, so little time! Perhaps in the future I'll come back to some of this and share my thoughts when I have a little more time!</p>
	<p>> Have been reading recently about "Accelerated Mobile Pages" and I am keen to implement at least some of these ideas into my website to speed up the load times on all platforms. Made the first little tweak to the main PHP docs for each page to set the page title and pull through the other content a little better.</p>
	<p>> Removed the "Euro 2016" link from the Links page, and replaced with "World Cup 2018".</p>

	<p>> In the quest to chase down things which may be slowing down page loads, I have been investigating an issue whereby I keep getting console error messages when loading the homepage in Chrome, which has been happening ever since I embedded a couple of youTube videos in my Blog. Had a look-see if there was anything I could do to stop this from happening - naturally I assumed that it was something that I'd gotten wrong in my embed code somehow. But looking into it I found <a href="https://code.google.com/p/google-cast-sdk/issues/detail?id=538" target="_blank">this</a> article, which explains that this is actually an issue with Google ChromeCast, and the devs are working to Blacklist these sorts of errors from appearing in the console. Many of these have been blacklisted already, but the couple that I am seeing will be resolved with the release of Chrome v52 - estimated 26 July. So I'll re-check in a week!</p>
	<p>> It's been a hot day - the temperature in the office has crept above 30 degrees! My laptop was feeling very hot this afternoon! Curious to see what the actual temperatures were, I installed <a href="http://www.piriform.com/speccy" target="_blank">Speccy</a>, a neat little tool from Piriform - the company that made CCleaner and Defraggler which are another two very useful apps for PC health. Anyhoo, the tool confirmed that the laptop temperatures were very hot indeed - especially the CPU which is running constantly at full tilt crunching BOINC workunits. The hard drive was registering in the red at 56 degrees!!</p>
	<p>> Remembering a cool trick I saw on a recent Facebook post, I placed several stacks of copper coins on/under the really hot parts of the laptop - which helps to draw heat out of the laptop since copper is a better conductor of heat than air is. It did work - bringing the HD temp down to 52 degrees. But then rather than continuing to decrease it began to creep up again - the coins had gotten too hot themselves. So the next thing I tried was to put the laptop on a granite kitchen workboard, which worked very well - a lot more material to disperse the excess heat. Got the HD temp down to 46 degrees before even that started to warm up a little too much. The heat tends to be concentrated more to one side than the other, so I can keep rotating the board to maintain this extra heatsink effect!</p>

	<h4>04 July 2016</h4>
	<p>> Went to the cinema at the weekend to see "Independence Day: Resurgence". Thought it would be a good idea to start a 'Movie Reviews' section on my site. Have posted a review under 'Interests'/'Cinema' for now, but I may create a new, more easily-accessible section for movie reviews as & when this grows. Enjoy.</p>

	<h4>30 June 2016</h4>
	<p>> Best news of the day - Boris has stepped down as a candidate for the Conservative leadership. TFFT! As much as I actually like the guy, I don't think he is the right fit for PM. He is like a little bit of light relief from "proper" politics. Good for a fun soundbite. A welcome guest on topical panel shows. An eccentric personality. A bit wibble. What he is not is somebody that I think could be taken seriously as a Prime Minister. Can you really imagine him engaging in serious talks with Obama / Putin / EU leaders over matters of national/global significance? Maybe he really could do the job but his outward character paints him as more a parliamentary jester rather than a serious politician.</p>
	<p>> So who are the other candidates still in the running?</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Theresa May</li>
		<li>Stephen Crabb</li>
		<li>Liam Fox</li>
		<li>Michael Gove</li>
		<li>Andrea Leadsom</li>
	</ul>
	<p>> Both May and Crabb were backing the 'Remain' campaign, so you would think that that ought to rule them out, although both apparently respect the will of the British people and are committed to getting the best deal possible without turning their back on the result or trying to weasel out of it. They may have good intentions, but if they genuinely didn't believe that we should leave the EU is their heart really in it?</p>
	<p>> Gove. On the back of his terrible record in other government departments e.g. education I have no trust that he won't completely balls the rest of the country up. Out.</p>
	<p>> Fox. The name is only vaguely familiar and I don't know a lot about the guy. Talks the right talk, and was in favour of Brexit... but I learned recently that he apparently voted against gay [equal] marriage. Not relevant to the EU situation but perhaps an indicator of his politics which may be altogether not very progressive. Maybe he will do for a couple of years just to get us through the Brexit negotiations but not sure he would be a good long-term choice. Is he the sort of person that would sign up to TTIP?</p>
	<p>> So that leaves Leadsom. Who? A Brexit supporter, she seems to have the right attitude in seeing this a great opportunity that the country can grasp with both hands. Apparently she impressed in her appearances on the live debates - but I didn't see those. Perhaps a rising star in UK politics but I don't think she is well-known enough to cut it as a party leader - especially not when the party in question is currently in power.</p>
	<p>> Meh! None of these options seem altogether attractive - and it is too much to expect that I will agree 100% with every aspect of their politics/outlook. As mentioned in my last post, the only person that really impressed me with the pro-Leave argument was Daniel Hannan MEP, but he has not declared an intention to stand and I believe the deadline is now passed. Sad face.</p>
	<p>> An interesting movement which is gaining traction is the call for a "Progressive Alliance" of the smaller political parties. The Green Party, Plaid Cymru, Lib Dems all banding together with the aim of defeating the Tories at the next General Election and putting forward some much better fairer policies to change the UK for the better (from a 'left-wing' point of view). A fairer electoral system, a ban on fracking, migrants welcome (although not clear on intention to control), and opposed to the Trident nuclear deterrent. This all sounds pretty good to me... but their number 1 priority at the moment is to keep the UK in the EU which I fundamentally do not agree with. Within the UK I think they may have a chance at some real change - but the EU is too big and too far gone to be reformed IMO.</p>

	<h4>29 June 2016</h4>
	<p>> Been a little while since my last update: busy with various household jobs, errands, wedding prep, watching the Euros, and the huge time-sponge that is the fall-out of the EU Referendum. Now, I didn't really want to get into politics on here - but with such a monumental and important period in UK history unfolding before us, and with much of my time invested in following the progress, I thought I might as well use my own self-created platform to share my thoughts and opinions. Heck, it's not like I actually expect anybody to read this... I suppose this is more to help crystallise my own thoughts.</p>
	<p>> So first of all: the official campaigns. What an utter shambles of both sides! Fear on one side versus more fear on the other - playing to the very things that the electorate would be anxious about and spreading ridiculous mis-truths about what the future would hold if we did/didn't vote one way or the other. 'Stronger In' would put about various doomsday scenarios for how bad the economy would be, and 'Vote Leave' warning we would be overrun by immigrants.</p>
	<p>> Rather than allowing myself to be sucked into all the propaganda and BS, I preferred instead to stick to Fact-checking sources which looked at what the campaign spokespeople were saying and independently verified or rejected the claims. I generally read a lot of content from the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news" target="_blank">BBC</a> (albeit whose objectivity might be questioned), <a href="https://fullfact.org/" target="_blank">Full Fact</a>, <a href="http://www.spectator.co.uk/" target="_blank">The Spectator</a>, and <a href="https://theconversation.com/uk">The Conversation</a>. Never before have I shown as much interest in politics and actually sought out as much information!</p>
	<p>> One thing that continuously irritated me was the suggestion that the UK pays in £350M to the EU every week. I learned very early on in the campaign that this is technically not true, since Thatcher agreed a rebate and the UK receives a certain chunk of this back in funding for various research/social projects. So this was only ever a gross figure, and rather misleading - but I suppose once you have daubed this all over your campaign bus it's difficult to go back on! - and the net figure is obviously not quite as sensationalist.</p>
	<img class="Img_20160629" src="images/euSpendPie.jpg" alt="EU Spend Piechart"/>
	<div class="clearfix visible-sm-block"></div>
	<div class="clearfix visible-xs-block"></div>
	<p>> However, the UK IS a net contributor to the EU and this still adds up to [I believe] something in the region of £8,500M net per year, and is only likely to increase in the future. High as this sounds, as a percentage of the UK's GDP/spending this only amounts to about 0.4% - which is not a lot in real terms, but where the country's finances are on a knife-edge every little helps. The argument goes that we could cease sending this money to the EU, and rather than being dictated to, WE COULD CHOOSE how we spend the money: it stands to reason we would at least match the funding for the EU projects and then have some left over which could go towards other things such as (but not limited to) the NHS. All of the austerity measures of the last few years saved LESS than what we put into the EU i.e. if we'd kept these funds for ourselves we could have abolished the austerity programme and still have some left over to play with.</p>
	<p>> 'Stronger In' [a.k.a. 'Project Fear']'s main lines of attack seemed to be in trying to convince the electorate not to take a leap into the [SCARY!!] unknown, and that we would be setting ourselves up for a "DIY Recession". So so many financial experts, institutions and economists giving grave and stark warnings about what could happen to the UK economy if we left the EU - and then Osborne spouting spurious results. For example, the report that analysed how the UK's growth would be affected by the year 2030. The headlines being that the UK could expect growth of at best -3% ["shock"] and at worst -6% ["severe shock"], and cost the equivalent of £4,300 per household. Although the basis for this was in sound economic models [as I understand it], the way that this was dressed up was pure spin! The models being used are not comparing the UK's GDP now with the UK's GDP in 2030 if we leave; this is a comparison with the GDP in 2030 if we left the EU versus if we stayed. Even in the "severe shock" scenario - where we leave the EU and don't have preferential access to the single market - the projected UK growth was actually 29%! This is 6% less than the projections for staying in the EU, which presumably would have the UK growth then at 35% by the year 2030. An average of 2% growth per year as a worst-case scenario does NOT sound to me like something to be overly concerned about! Further, dividing the GDP by the number of households is intentionally misleading - this is not a measure of how much difference the actual household income would be!</p>
	<p>> Sure, maybe over that period we may find that the GDP would be higher, and the UK would be better off financially, but that is a big MAYBE! And I'm not so sure... what variables/assumptions were plugged into this model? More likely than not this takes as pessimistic a view as possible to try and sell the "Leave" vote as a bad idea. I think the "severe shock" scenario is unlikely: the EU's economy depends on the UK having good trade deals with it because of the sheer value of their exports to us. Wine, cheese, cars - the French and Germans absolutely would not stand to lose us as a valued customer. Putting up trade barriers/tariffs to us would be cutting off their nose to spite their face. Bad for the economy, bad for relations, not co-operative. Leaving the EU is without doubt a massive kick in the pants to those in the upper echelons of the project but they can't afford to get too shitty with us about it.</p>
	<img src="images/euTrade.jpg" alt="eu Trade" style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 20px; width: 100%; max-width: 640px;"/>
	<div class="clearfix visible-md-block"></div>
	<p>> Where the EU really hurts the UK is in trade. The map shows all of the countries that the EU has a trade deal with, or has made some progress in making one. It really isn't much is it? Huge and growing economies in Asia are left out. Even the USA is grey! TTIP is on the table but that's a whole different kettle of fish!</p>
	<p>> Our hands are completely tied in this - whilst we are part of the EU all power is with Brussels and we are unable to make our own trade deals with growing and emerging economies in the rest of the world. There were stark warnings from the 'Remain' camp that it would take us decades to establish trade routes with these countries, but - by the sounds of it - far from being an onerous task, it seems many countries are falling over themselves so keen are they to agree trade deals on the back of the 'Leave' vote. Obama is famously quoted as saying that if the UK leaves the EU we will be "at the back of the queue" when it comes to agreeing trade deals. But he rapidly changed his tune too: more blatant scaremongering / bluffing and we called him on it! Although saying that, some observers have argued that without the EU "having our back" the US may think they can more easily push through a TTIP-style agreement with the UK and a more willing Conservative government.</p>
	<p>> The EU struggles to make trade deals because they are trying to keep every one of the member nations happy, and if sufficient nations veto then more negotiations have to go ahead. Outside the EU, a trade deal with the UK and country X has only the interests of those two nations to be concerned about. Much simpler. Do the doomsday scenarios predicted by the financial institutions take this into account? Doubtful - but I don't know for sure. My feeling is that this would be too positive a message for the 'Remain' side to report for their campaign, and they were insistent that new trade deals would take several years of negotiations.</p>
	<p>> Even IF the 'Remain' side had a valid economic argument, it is moot: based only on models, assumptions, and conjecture. The institutions that come up with these reports are the very institutions that failed to predict massive problems/crashes in the past e.g. the financial crisis of 2007/2008, "Black Wednesday", etc. So what happened on the actual evening/morning that the referendum results came in? The markets absolutely shit themselves! Obviously all of the Bremainians were quick to jump on the "Project Fear has become Project Fact" bandwagon, saying "we told you so" with a curious expression of smugness, fear and panic on their faces. But was it really THAT bad? Sure, the GBP fell a long way against the USD initially before recovering some ground - but if the traders had been more prepared and more understanding of the sentiment of the British people they would not have had such misplaced confidence of the result being in favour of 'Remain' and would have prepared more for this. If you look at the FTSE-100 index the effect of the referendum result is barely noticeable amongst the usual 'noise' of the continuous up/down of general trading - and is still higher than it was only earlier this year. The FTSE-250 fared a little worse but has by no means fallen to unprecedented levels. The charts below are from <a href="http://www.londonstockexchange.com/home/homepage.htm" target="_blank">London Stock Exchange</a> and <a href="http://www.xe.com" target="_blank">XE</a> and show the long term historical trends of the GBP-USD and the FTSE indices.</p>

	<div class="clearfix visible-xs-block"></div>
	<div class="clearfix visible-sm-block"></div>	
	
	<p>> In all cases, the initial shock and drop in the markets is already showing signs of recovery - but it has been barely a week and one cannot REALLY say one way or the other how things are going based on such short-term fluctuations. What traders and investors do not like is RISK, and there are a lot of things in the air at the moment:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The UK's position in the EU regarding trade, and 'divorcing' from the union</li>
		<li>Petitions for the In/Out vote to be repeated</li>
		<li>The leadership challenge to be the next PM</li>
		<li>Scotland's insistence on wanting a 2nd referendum on independence, to allow it to rejoin the EU</li>
		<li>Noises about re-unification of Ireland</li>
		<li>Wales getting in on the independence act</li>
	</ul>
	<p>> The future is more uncertain now than it was before the referendum, and it is no surprise - it was actually expected - that in the short term there would be some volatility in the markets whilst this all got sorted out. It is the long-term picture that I think is more important. The EU is the only trading bloc which has failed to show any significant economic growth in the last 10 years. The Euro is a failing currency. Unemployment levels in Spain, Greece, etc, are frighteningly high. The project is failing and more bail-outs are surely on the cards. Sticking with the EU as it is would be grim enough, but how much worse will the EU's economic situation be in a couple of decades time?</p>
	<p>> But all this talk of economics and markets has very little to do with the reasons why I (and many others) voted the way that we did. The future cannot be accurately predicted, so what actuals facts were involved in the debate? The hot topics as far as I was concerned were Sovereignty and Immigration. Before the referendum campaigns were in full swing I was of the mindset of "better the devil you know", "if it ain't broke, don't fix it", etc. But I wanted to feel that I was able to make a properly informed decision come referendum day, and I didn't really know an awful lot about the ins and outs of what the EU was, how it worked, etc. A documentary presented by Jeremy Paxman was a real eye-opener for me, and I began to realise that the EU is not just inefficient and wasteful (as I had suspected, only more so!), but over the course of a couple of decades has been gradually chipping away at the sovereignty of the member nations. Initially set up as a trading bloc, it has grown into a political union/project/experiment with far too much control over the laws of the member nations. A massively bureaucratic exercise, there are multiple presidents, a commission, a parliament. Considering how much the Germans pride themselves on how efficient they are and like everything to be, it is startling that they are such proponents of this ridiculous circus! Those that make the laws are NOT elected, and the public whom they "serve" have no means of removing them from power. And they are hell-bent on achieving the goal of creating a "United States of Europe" where ALL laws, currency, taxation, regulation, etc are controlled from Brussels - indifferent to the damage that it is causing to the members.</p>
	<p>> In a way I do kind of understand the attraction of the USoE idea: a large nation under one roof that can match the established and growing economic powers of the USA, Russia, China, and other Asian countries/blocs much more readily than the individual European countries on their own. And were this to come to pass, surely the UK would be in a prime position with London being such a major centre for trade, business, and travel. If there was equality across all EU members with regards to pay and benefits then perhaps the mass immigration from eastern European countries into the wealthier countries of the UK, France and Germany would be reduced.</p>
	<p>> However, the implementation of this is badly flawed and - as mentioned above - has already caused serious damage to some countries, with more sure to follow - EVEN IF the people of that country try to elect a government that opposes the EU they are over-ruled. The solution from Brussels is MORE integration, and the problem only gets worse. The EU would have to be significantly more transparent in the way that it operates, and fundamentally more democratic, if this idea would ever have a chance. There is an argument that the EU is not just undemocratic, but appallingly ANTI-democratic. When a politician of a country is NOT elected to power - and the country's electorate have expressly rejected this person - it is not uncommon for this politician to get a job as a Eurocrat and therefore create/influence EU policy which would have to be followed by the country that rejected them. What the hell kind of system is this?!?</p>
	<p>> The more I learned about what the EU is and the way that it operates, the more I became convinced that we need to get out of it. I think a majority of people - whether voting 'Remain' or 'Leave' - would agree that the EU has its flaws and is badly in need of reform. The difference is that the Bremainians think we should stay in because we will have more success at fixing the problems from within than as a bystander, whereas I think that they are already past the point of no return. It is unreformable: any attempt at trying to change things is either outvoted or vetoed.</p>
	<p>> Of course, a great number of EU rules & regulations that we follow are quite sensible with regards to environmental and all sorts of other important wide/global issues... but there are so so many other regulations that they stick their nose into that could & should be decided by individual countries. Big business loves all these regulations - and likely lobby for them - since they can afford all the legal costs associated with them, but it's the small businesses that can really suffer with all the red tape - regardless of whether or not the business is with other EU countries or if it is purely domestic. Result: small businesses cannot compete; corporations win. How is that a good thing?</p>
	<p>> The other problem in trying to create a USoE is that it is trying to pull together 500M people from dozens of countries across a large continent, each of which have a unique history, their own cultures and idiosyncrasies, their own way of doing things, their own feeling of identity. How on earth are you going to get all these countries to decide and agree on ANYTHING? Part of the reason why agreeing new trade deals with other countries outside the EU has proved to be so troublesome. And significantly more often than not, the UK's vote on a policy/issue is outnumbered by opposition. The cultural differences between nations is something to be celebrated - why would anybody want to move to a future where everybody is just a beige European?</p>
	<p>> Every country in Europe can be friends with every other country in Europe. We can work together, we can trade together, we can help each other, we can defend each other, we can be absolutely the best of neighbours and flourish in our own way. There is absolutely no need to bring every country together in a political- and fiscal- union to achieve any of that.</p>
	<p>> And so on to the subject of immigration. I think immigration is GOOD. A great majority of immigrants to the UK are hard-working people, they pay their taxes, they provide a good net contribution to the economy - albeit with some of their income being sent to family from their originating country. And likewise, UK residents should be welcomed to any other country of their choosing to live/work/study and contribute to their economy. This is a wholly beneficial system, from each individuals' point of view and for each country's economy as whole.</p>
	<p>> The problem that we have with immigration is the EU's insistence on complete freedom of movement as a pre-requisite for access to the single market. Being one of the wealthier countries in the EU, the UK is an attractive place for anybody to settle - and at the current rate there are around 330,000 net immigrants arriving in the UK every year. That is approximately the population of the city of Newcastle (or the entire country of Iceland) settling here every year - and there is no limit under EU rules. There are several towns & cities that have been the focus of immigration and they are feeling understandably inundated: this high level of 'artificial' population growth continues to put additional pressure on public services such as the hospitals, GPs, schools, as well as creating a high demand for housing - which disadvantages immigrant and native alike. Whilst it could be argued that this is at least in part the fault of successive governments to fail to fund and provide the requisite level of infrastructure to cope with this, how can we possibly budget for it when there are no limits and no control? We could budget to build housing for 330,000 people, but next year there could be half a million or more.</p>
	<p>> The tag-line of the 'Leave' campaign was "Take Back Control". Some narrow-minded racist cretins seem to have taken this to mean that not only should we reduce immigration to ZERO, but that we should deport all the immigrants that have already settled here. Xenophobic poppycock rubbish of the absolute highest order. It is distasteful that one should tick the same vote box as this tiny minority, albeit for entirely different reasons. As mentioned above, immigrants have a lot to offer for the country - and do indeed contribute massively to public services, the NHS being a prime example. By having a level of control we would have an opportunity to implement, for example, an Australian-style points system whereby we could welcome immigrants with skills that the country has a shortage of - and not just from within the EU! If anything the current "open door" immigration is discriminatory against non-EU humans, whereas EU residents can come and go as they please.</p>
	<p>> Removing the shackles of the EU gives us the opportunity to open our doors to the rest of the world for trade, for exchange of skilled labour, to collaborate in study/research. Many bitter Bremainians have accused Brexiteers of being insular, but I think reaching out to the rest of the world is the complete opposite! Before the referendum we were all citizens of Earth; and after the referendum we all still are. Europe-Shmeurope!</p>
	<p>> I think <a href="http://www.hannan.co.uk" target="_blank">Danial Hannan MEP</a> puts across some excellent arguments for why the UK will be better off out of the EU. There a couple of videos below that I would recommend watching.</p>
	<iframe class="Img_20160629 vidEmbed" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/FC9nDCmqjn8"></iframe>

	<div class="clearfix visible-md-block"></div>
	<div class="clearfix visible-sm-block"></div>
	<div class="clearfix visible-xs-block"></div>
	<p>> So where do we go from here? Confidence already seems to be returning to the markets - they are likely to bounce around a little whilst they find their level, but once everybody realises that the sky isn't falling in, and the treasury and the Bank of England are fully prepared for (if not actually expecting) a Leave vote things will be more settled.</p>
	<p>> Helping to calm the markets it will be crucial to resolve the issues mentioned in the list above. The EU are apparently very keen for the UK to get on with triggering Article 50 and begin the 2-year countdown for the 'divorce' negotiations to proceed. You know what, EU? Screw you! A HUGE reason for us wanting to get out of the EU is that we're fed up of being pushed around. I thought Cameron's speech on Friday morning was very well-measured and magnanimous in defeat. It totally makes sense that he would step down and allow a new pro-Leave leader to take his place and begin the Brexit talks - but that leadership contest of course will take a little time.</p>
	<p>> As keen as I am that leaving the EU will be a good thing long-term, it always troubled me that it could lead to handing more power over to our incumbent Conservative government who have more interest in doing what's best for themselves and their rich mates than they are for the general public - at least that's my take on it given the various austerity measures and the like. But even more pressing than that, given Cameron's resignation, is who should take the reigns until the next General Election? The figureheads of the 'Vote Leave' campaign do not exactly inspire confidence: Boris, Gove, IDS - no thanks! I suppose of all those Boris would be the least-worst option... but he is a bumbling clown. He's like just a little bit of light relief from real politics, somebody you go to for an amusing soundbite - we wouldn't seriously let him in as our Prime Minister, would we? WOULD WE??</p>
	<p>> Both Gove's and IDS's reputations precede them: their terrible previous handling of government departments such as Education and Welfare pretty much rule them both out as incapable and certainly not credible candidates. The latest news is that even Jeremy Hunt is throwing his name into the hat. Don't even get me started on Jeremy Hunt! His negotiation skills over the Junior Doctors fiasco left a heck of a lot to be desired and for a brief period - if not still currently - he was basically the most despised politician in the UK, jostling with Nigel Farage for position at the top of the "Most Punchable Face" league table.</p>
	<p>> Given a free choice of Conservative party members, I would choose Daniel Hannan MEP. He is obviously busy at the moment being an MEP but that's a position with a sell-by date on it. He comes across to me as a very reasonable and logical chap. He is a great orator, and maybe I'm just taken in by his near perfect intonation and tempo as he delivers his prepared speeches. It is quite shocking how much he has been derided following the Leave vote - accusations of him going back on what his reasons were for voting 'Leave'. Completely untrue and unfair, and he's dealt with this blow-back very well indeed.</p>
	<p>> Despite over 3.5M signatures now on the petition for the referendum result to be overturned, or for the vote to be repeated, and with big names like Richard Branson in favour of a re-run, I don't think there will be any going back on it. Cameron completely dismissed the suggestion of a "neverendum" in case of a narrow victory for 'Remain' so he is quite right to stick to his guns and not allow it now. The referendum does of course actually have no legal standing - it is merely assessing the view of the electorate on the issue. So many reports (of actually probably a very small minority) of people that say they wish that they'd voted 'Remain' given the immediate turbulence in the markets and 'Vote Leave' apparently "U-turning on their promises". Also the younger generation that are upset that they'll have to live with the consequences the longest, when they [in general] voted 'Remain' and typically the older generations voting 'Leave'. However, as <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/eu-referendum-brexit-young-people-upset-by-the-outcome-of-the-eu-referendum-why-didnt-you-vote-a7105396.html" target="_blank">this</a> article succinctly explains, the turnout of younger voters was woefully low - only 36%. I have no idea where they get the demographic information from about turnout/votes for each age group, by the way! But if any of this is true, it is clearly not the older generation that young people should be angry at, but the rest of their kind for being so apathetic and not exercising their democratic right to make their voice heard - so they think they can over-rule it with an online petition. Nope, sorry - that is NOT how democracy works. And besides, being the generation that lives with the consequences for the longest will not be a bad thing!! I can't know that with 100% certainty of course, but for all the reasons given in this Blog post I am confident that a post-Brexit Britain will be a better place than one stuck under the anti-democracy of the EU. That said, it is entirely within the government's power to disregard the referendum result, since a majority of MPs actually backed 'Remain' - but how undemocratic would THAT be?! Forcing a General Election whereby the winning party's manifesto states they will NOT trigger Article 50 may be a democratic way of avoiding Brexit - but if they try that would we end up with a UKIP government because the electorate are absolutely insistent on leaving the EU and no other party is actually that keen? Yikes!</p>
	<p>> Scotland. No huge surprise that as soon as the results were announced, Nicola Sturgeon [a.k.a. Wee Jimmy Krankie] got straight on with Project IndyRef2. I do kind of see her point. If Scotland were co-erced into voting to remain in the UK on the basis that it would guarantee them also remaining in the EU than I could well imagine they'd be a bit annoyed at how things have turned out! That is only an "IF" - I'm not sure whether or not that is the actual case. But what do we know: 2 years ago a small majority of Scots voted to stay in the UK; in last year's General Election, the SNP took a landslide victory - overwhelmingly booting out whatever Labour/LibDem MPs they had; and just now a majority of Scots voted to remain in the EU. Not necessarily the same majority that wanted to remain in the UK 2 years ago but there will be some overlap to one degree or another. What I would be interested in is would the Scots rather be a part of the UK OR the EU - because that is essentially the choice they now face [or not - depending on if they are actually granted a 2nd referendum]. The meaning of the word "Independence" seems to change depending on who you ask. The Brexiteers are celebrating their "Independence" from the EU, but the Scots apparently want "Independence" so that they can JOIN the EU. Eh?! Win your independence so you can sacrifice it all again and give in to the power-hungry failing political union that we just saved you from? Between fishing rights (and oil?), the Scots have a lot to gain from getting out of the EU. There is no guarantee the EU would accept their request to join - I think a couple of countries have already stated they would veto it! - and I don't think they could survive economically on their own outside of the UK. BUT if that is the will of the people then just like Brexit that is what the politicians must adhere to.</p>
	<p>> A much better idea I feel is for Krankie to stop banging her drums and give it a rest for a few years. Let the dust settle after the UK leaves the EU and see how things are looking. A massive failure of the EU is in not taking the UK's concerns seriously. Cameron went to them to negotiate better terms back in February and he got Sweet Fanny Adams from them. A few minor concessions that are practically worthless. What the UK government MUST do with Scotland is the exact opposite. LISTEN to their concerns, make them feel that the UK government is actually working for them. Take your London-centric heads out of your arses and look beyond the M25 at the rest of the country that is being woefully neglected.</p>
	<p>> Ireland. Wow, I'm not even going to go there: I freely admit to not knowing anywhere near enough about "The Troubles" to make any kind of comment about what effect Brexit might have on this. I can see that having an EU/non-EU land border is going to be awkward... and that's all I'm going to say about that.</p>
	<p>> Wales. Jumping on the "Independence" bandwagon, Leanne Wood has stated that Wales also want out of the UK to get back into the EU. Her case is considerably less convincing than Scotland's, however, since most of Wales voted to LEAVE the EU. I really don't know where she is going with this. Maybe just a referendum to see where things lie, but - as with Scotland - I think the best thing is rather than rocking the boat just keep schtum for a little while until the UK sorts its position out with the rest of Europe.</p>
	<p>> There a number of different economic/trade models that the UK could seek to pursue in reaching an exit agreement. Countries such as Iceland, Norway, Switzerland are not in the EU but are allowed access to the single market under certain conditions - and following one of these models might be a quicker more painless way of getting out of the political union without adversely affecting trade. One thing that these models have in common is the EU's golden rule that if you want access to the single market then you must abide by the Four Freedoms: goods, services, capital, and people. That is, we would still have to have free movement of people which wouldn't solve the immigration problem. Maybe we could negotiate on that, but it's something that no other nation has succeeded on getting a compromise on and I can't see the EU being in a generous mood with a country that has decided to 'divorce' from them!</p>
	<p>> The 'Norway' model might be a way forward: it would keep us in the EEA whilst allowing us to dispense with certain fishing and agricultural policies which currently hurt us, and allow us to broker trade deals of our own with countries outside of the EU. Sounds good, but it has its disadvantages: in addition to keeping the free movement of people, we would still have to pay a membership fee (with or without the rebates/EU funding, I'm not sure) and we would still have to abide by all the EU rules and regulations - but without having a seat at the table to debate/veto any of these. "We pay but have no say". In some respects this could be seen as a step backwards from our current position, but it does open up more opportunities for trade and let's be honest Norway seem to be doing very well for themselves with this arrangement. They have a significantly smaller population though, and what works for them might not work as well for a country with a huge financial metropolitan hub such as London.</p>
	<p>> We could try to play hardball with the EU: try to get good access to the single market with some concessions on immigration. Depends how much they need us to keep buying their stuff. Case in point: the Germans would have a hell of a lot to lose if we stopped buying their cars.</p>
	<p>> Another dimension to Brexit is the impact that this will have on the rest of the EU. The UK is not the only member whose people are dissatisfied with the current situation. There are loud rumblings from several other countries that want to hold their own referendums and be given a voice on whether they too should remain or leave: Greece, Spain, France, Netherlands to name just a few. The EU would obviously like to make an example out of the UK, and demonstrate to the other countries that leaving the "loving embrace" of the EU results in a negative outcome. But they can't screw us over trade without seriously hurting themselves. Unless they can commit to huge reforms I think the EU is doomed. Maybe out of the ashes of the EU will rise a much better concept: transparent, democratic, focused on good relations by trade and not political union.</p>
	<p>> Whatever happens, however this plays out, one thing is for certain: it is going to be interesting! To paraphrase Terminator / Back To The Future: there is no fate but what we make - the future isn't written yet, so make it a good one!</p>

	<h4>21 June 2016</h4>
	<p>> Installed Windows 10 on my laptop, and spent a good deal of time tweaking the settings as I had done with my desktop PC. Having done it once before I was already prepared for the minor annoyances so it was much easier to deal with this time!</p>
	<p>> I did come across a new strange issue, though: realised that when I run BOINC now on my laptop the CPU clock speed is for some reason throttled at 70-80% of it's actual capability - even with all four logical processors at 100% demand. Wondered if this was a new power-saving feature of Win10, but even with all the Power Settings configured to Maximum Performance the issue was still apparent. With a little research I found I was of course not the only one to notice this peculiarity after a Win10 upgrade. The solution I found was to find each of the processors in Device Manager and change the driver from the Intel one to a generic one. Restarted the laptop and the CPU is now back to working at full capacity.</p>
	<p>> Whilst I was browsing various sites looking into the CPU issue I came across several articles and resources regarding performance monitoring which absorbed a fair bit of my time!</p>
	<p>> This afternoon & evening I got both my desktop PC & laptop busy ripping a bunch of DVDs into MKVs and MP4s to add to our iTunes library, whilst I gave most of my attention the various Euro 2016 matches that decided the final positions for a couple of groups. The desktop PC is also still busy defragmenting the 3TB drive! Been at it literally over 24 hours!</p>

	<p>> Happy Solstice, Earth-dwellers!!!</p>
	<p>> Early start this morning to get Keira to the KIA dealership in Chippenham for her first MOT and 3rd annual service. Expecting I'd have a few hours to kill whilst I waited I brought my laptop with me to fill in a bit of missing Blog detail, take advantage of the Guest Wi-fi for some Internet browsing, and to add a few more sites to my <a href="links.php">Links</a> page.</p>
	<p>> In the afternoon I made a start on preparing my laptop for the upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 10 - same as I did with my desktop PC the other day, beginning with creating a recovery CD and disk images with Macrium Reflect. Set Win10 to download overnight...</p>
	<p>> Also this afternoon I had a look at the new external 3TB drive on Defraggler - just out of interest to see how fragmented it was now that it's got over 1TB of disk images, backups, and video files on it. Turns out quite a lot as a percentage, even though only 9 files were actually fragmented. The 2 disk image files were fragmented and totalled ~400GB of disk space. Did not think it would take long to defrag 9 files, but boy was I wrong! Left that going over night, too...</p>

	<p>> Had a quick look at how my Seti@Home tasks were doing: it appears that when I'm not using the PC the GPU tasks are able to progress much quicker without constantly postponing due to insufficient memory - I guess when the GUI is not in use Windows releases some of the VRAM and makes it available to BOINC to get on with stuff?</p>

	<h4>17 June 2016</h4>
	<p>> Set Windows 10 installing on my desktop PC this morning. Initial impressions are good: from a user point-of-view it looks & works very much the same way as Windows 7. A few different things: some good, some bad. Spent a fair bit of time going through the Control Panel and tweaking what I could to make it more like what I like. Not keen on the chunkier title bars but I could get used to that. The clock was displayed in 12-hr format [yuck!], and when I went to change it Windows reported that it was picking the settings up from the default [and only available] Language Pack that was installed: US English. Hmph!! So I could have just manually configured the clock format to suit, but there would have been all sorts of other annoyances [date format, currency?] without the correct region selected, so I downloaded & installed the correct Language Pack and binned the original.</p>
	<p>>But apart from a few little niggles I'm fairly happy with it. Seemed to take a bit of time to get the most up-to-date display driver installed, though: the nVidia installer wanted to restart to begin the installation (probably because I'd selected 'Clean Install') so when Windows came back up there was no specific driver installed and the screen resolution was all crappy. However, the installation then hung! So I had to re-install a Windows driver and try it again, this time without the Clean Install option.</p>
	<p>>It worked but one curious thing is that the Seti@Home BOINC tasks that utilise the GPU are now continuously postponing themselves due to insufficient graphics memory. Never had this issue before. I think the reason is that perhaps Win10 has "Aero"-type themes on all the time which just eats into the VRAM more than the non-Aero theme I had on Win7. When BOINC loads it does show how much VRAM is available for tasks - I've now got around 170MB but it's not something I looked at prior to upgrading so not sure if there is a large difference - my graphics card only had 256MB on board to begin with which is very much at the lower end of what is useful for BOINC. The tasks do appear to still be progressing but only for 30s at a time! Will keep an eye on it.</p>

	<h4>16 June 2016</h4>
	<p>> I've still not taken the plunge and installed Windows 10 yet - and there are only ~6 weeks remaining to grab it whilst it is free! The major concern is that something goes wrong with the installation and it completely cocks up my system. I have rather less enthusiasm for installing systems fresh than I used to in my teens! But now that I have a juicy big external hard drive to back things up to, I have downloaded <a href="http://www.macrium.com/reflectfree.aspx" target="_blank">Macrium Reflect</a> on recommendation of <a href="http://dvoit.co.uk" target="_blank">DVO IT</a>, created a bootable recovery CD, and I am in the process of creating disk images so that I have a solid backup plan should anything go tits up.</p>
	<p>> Whilst the disks are being imaged, I have added an extra item on the <a href="links.php">Links</a> page: a Facebook post reminded me of a website that tracks the positions of London Tube trains, and I thought it was pretty cool and potentially useful :D.</p>
	<p>> It's getting on for early afternoon and Macrium is still beavering away imaging the disks. I'm off down the pub for a few pints of Arkell's 3B and to watch the England v Wales Euro 2016 match.</p>
	<p>> Came back to it in the evening - the disk imaging (and verification) took almost 6 hours. Glad I didn't stick around waiting for that. Backup plan now in force, I set the Windows 10 upgrade downloading overnight.</p>

	<h4>14 June 2016</h4>
	<p>> Continued with putting together the Maths page - mainly a JavaScript exercise to dynamically create the HTML and pose random maths problems of different types.</p>
	<p>> Started with the 'Addition' section, and basically used this as a template for the other operators. A couple of them had a bit more logic required to ensure the problem met certain conditions (i.e. the solution was not negative and not a fraction). The JavaScript is quite bloaty - a lot of repeated code from copying & pasting which could do with streamlining, but it works. On the desktop 'tabbed' version, that is - next task is to ensure this also works on the mobile 'menu' version.</p>
	<p>> Spent a chunk of time getting the Maths page to work on both mobile and desktop versions. Encountered problems due to the JavaScript / jQuery accessing element #IDs to either initiate an event or get/set data/content: since a copy of the code gets pulled for both the desktop and mobile versions the #ID selectors were not working. After a fair bit of playing around I worked out a solution which involves accessing .classes rather than #IDs for the most part, and including a bit of Bootstrap hiding/showing where required.</p>
	<p>> Had some work to do to cut down the code size: a lot of the styles I was generating dynamically in-line within the JavaScript and there was a lot of duplication, so I've been through all of this and created a separate CSS file to cover.</p>
	<p>> Also then spent a little time further improving the appearance of the page for different display widths - adding Bootstrap class names, along with some other CSS @media queries.</p>
	<p>> Pretty happy with this new page - added to the main navigation to allow user access.</p>

	<h4>13 June 2016</h4>
	<p>> Investigating further into the homepage load-time issue. If I disable the loading of the "Interests" and "Blog" sections it refreshes super-quick on reload once cached - under 600ms. Much better! As I thought - it IS the loading of all this content that is slowing things down. Currently looking into how I can set the content of these tabs to be loaded via AJAX. The content is not displayed to the user on initial load, so it seems sensible to hold off loading all this content until it is actually required. A couple of concerns are that I don't need to keep re-fetching the same section content over AJAX per pageload; and I'm not sure what effect this will have on the tab heights i.e. it may cause some content to "spill-over" outside of the wrapper-background. We shall see...</p>
	<p>> Success! Figured out how to set the tabs to load via an AJAX call rather than on creation of the tabs. That was the easy part. It came with difficulties:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The accordion structures for the "Interests" and the "Blog" were not being displayed once I'd clicked the appropriate tab. Tried moving the accordion creation code into a separate function in the main JS file which is then called upon clicking the tab list item, but this did not seem to work - unless I clicked the same tab again once the content had been loaded in over AJAX. Not ideal. The solution I came up with was just to include the JavaScript in-line after the HTML code to describe the accordion.</li>
		<li>The accordion appears, but although the headers can be seen there is no content visible on the drop-downs. Bit of a strange one, but didn't take me long to realise what the issue was. All of the content within the sub-sections is pulled in through PHP <code>include()</code> functions - and it seems to be the case that when grabbing these over AJAX it doesn't work if the files being called have .html extensions. Renamed the files to have .php extensions and hey presto, the content appears!</li>
		<li>As I suspected might the case, the tab heights were an issue. When viewing content within the accordion, since the tab height was already set, an additional scrollbar was appearing so that I could scroll to the bottom of the content only within the fixed tab area. To get around this I added an additional bit of JavaScript to refresh the tab heights when the sub-section header was clicked. This almost worked, but not quite: sometimes the very bottom of some sub-sections was spilling out of the tab area. Changed the code to fire upon a window scroll event instead. Bazinga!</li>
	</ul>
	<p>> Happy that I'd sussed out the "Interests" and "Blog" sections, I thought I might as well use the same logic on other sections of the homepage to further improve initial load times, and likewise on other pages that use the vertical tabs [AstroPics, BOINC, Sepsis]. After implementing this on the rest of the homepage though, I decided that I didn't like the look of it: when only the default tab has content loaded initially, all the other tabs have an initial height of essentially zero - so the background does not fill the screen. Reverting back to loading the other two tabs ["Education" and "Development"] on pageload doesn't affect the loadtime considerably - I've got it down to about 1 second - quite an improvement on the 6-7 seconds it was taking before!! So OK, the "Interests" and "Blog" sections don't appear instantaneously as they did before, since these now require a server call - but it's a fair compromise. The other pages were all loading in well under a second so decided it wasn't really worth implementing the AJAX on these.</p>
	<p>> Another bonus of the AJAX is that it actually improves the load time of the mobile version too, which is nice :). Even though the mobile version doesn't use the verticalTabs navigation, it was still loading the content for the sake of responsiveness.</p>
	<p>> Had a thought this evening that it would be quite nice to create a page for my step-son that generated simple maths problems (or "number sentences" as his school calls them) for him to practice. Made a start on it <a href="maths.php">here</a> but my progress seems to be somewhat slow. A lot of the jQuery that I'm trying to execute is just not working for some reason. Simple things like assigning a function to a click event do not work when using an #ID as a selector - but DO work when assigning a .class as a selector. WTF?? Spent far longer than I imagined I would need to just trying to get around stoopid problems like that.</p>
	<p>> Thinking about all the jQuery issues I've been having, it occurred to me that it might be a similar problem to one that I had earlier today where the accordion content was not displaying - which was rectified by having the content file declared as a PHP rather than HTML document. Tried it. Worked. Hallelujah!! Hopefully I'll be able to make more significant progress on this now!!</p>

	<p>> Discovered a slight "bug" with the couple of F1-related hrefs on the <a href="links.php">Links</a> page. Corrected the URLs and uploaded changes.</p>

<article id="20160610">
	<h4>10 June 2016</h4>
	<p>> Although happy at the moment with the general look & function of the website, I am a little dismayed at how long some of the pages take to load. The homepage for instance can take 6 or 7 seconds for the initial load, and still 4 or 5 seconds even with caching. So I've spent a little time today looking into what is taking too long.</p>
	<p>> The first thing I noticed was that <em>index.php</em> was taking the bulk of the loading time and was over 1MB in size! Now I know there is a lot of content, but it's only really text and HTML and this seemed highly suspect - even considering that a lot of the content would be pulled through twice (once for the mobile version and once for the larger displays).</p>
	<p>> Browsing through the HTML output, I realised that there were some large sections of commented-out content. I had an <code>include()</code> function within a &lt;?php ?&gt; section inside an HTML document, but this was commented-out with the &lt;!-- --&gt; symbols so I didn't think it would actually call the <code>include()</code> function. But obviously it still was, and keeping it from being displayed with the enclosing comment symbols. I still wanted the code in there as I may in the future want to display this content, so I commented-out the <code>include()</code> function itself.</p>
	<p>> That cleared away some of the filesize that was loading, but it still seemed awfully large. After a little more searching I found that the content on the two largest sections ["Interests" and "Blog"] was being loaded not twice, but FOUR times! I figured out this was because both the 'mobile' versions of these sections and the 'desktop' versions were calling the same sub-section selection code, whether it was to be the 'selectmenu' or 'accordion' that was actually displayed to the user. So, for example, the 'Music' sub-section was getting called from:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>'selectmenu'-&gt;'selectmenu'</li>
		<li>'selectmenu'-&gt;'accordion'</li>
		<li>'verticalTab'-&gt;'selectmenu'</li>
		<li>'verticalTab'-&gt;'accordion'</li>
	</ol>
	<p>> Now, calls 2 and 3 are totally pointless: the 'accordion' sub-sections [desktop-only] will never be displayed at the same time as the primary 'selectmenu' [mobile-only]; and vice-versa with 'selectmenu' and 'verticalTab'. And this was happening for every one of the "Interests" and "Blog" sub-sections - some of which are rather large!</p>
	<p>> So I came up with a better way of calling these: splitting-out the secondary selection code into 'selectmenu' only and 'verticalTab' only versions. This has now removed all the unnecessary duplication - only calls 1 & 4 are now in effect. The good news is that this has roughly halved the filesize of <em>index.php</em> and likewise roughly halved the loading time of the homepage. YAY! However, at 2 to 3 seconds, it still seems to me that this is taking too long. I can still see a lot of the content for a good second or more before the CSS/jQuery functions kick-in and display the page as intended. Testing the mobile version on my iPhone is actually less annoying, since NONE of the page loads until it is fully ready to be displayed. I feel there is more I can do to improve on this, but I am out of time today and will pick up on this later!</p>

	<h4>09 June 2016</h4>
	<p>> Continued where I left off yesterday with adding the jQuery effects on the mouseover, mouseout and click events for the items within the accordion content.</p>
	<p>> Had some difficulties in getting it to behave exactly as I wanted using jQuery. I could get a background and a text colour of an element to change on mouseover, but moving the cursor onto a child of that element caused the mouseout event to fire in error. Tried inserting all sorts of extra jQuery to handle the parent, grandparent, child, grandchild elements. So much code and tbh it didn't really help matters. Much simpler to use the CSS :hover class, although the effects are more limited: couldn't get the nice fade-out effect of the backgrounds this way. Ho-hum, it'll do!</p>
	<p>> I'm happy now with the appearance of the "Interests" sub-section on both mobile and larger screens. Need to now implement the accordion effect on the tab version of the Blog sub-section in place of the non-functioning selectmenu.</p>
	<p>> Blog sub-section has now been accordion-ised! This has now sorted out all of the remaining issues that came from implementing the Vertical Tabs for the homepage, and it's all working and looking nice - phew! I'll upload these changes to the main site... THEN I still have another couple of pages to convert to the Vertical Tab structure [Astropics & Sepsis]. These are a little simpler than the homepage - no sub-sections to worry about - so hopefully won't take too long.</p>
	<p>> Astropics Vertical Tabs.... Done!</p>
	<p>> Sepsis Vertical Tabs... Done! Also tweaked Bootstrap/CSS/content of the Sepsis sections a little to improve the appearance and flow.</p>
	<p>> Had a good look through the main JavaScript & CSS files to find and delete all the code that is now redundant i.e. relating to the #sidebar-wrapper, secondary burger menu, and animated effects that are no longer in use having been superseded by the Vertical Tabs implementation. Also condensed the CSS that deals with the selectmenu buttons to style them all based on the .class rather than individual #IDs. Aaaah feels good to unbloat!</p>

	<h4>08 June 2016</h4>
	<p>> Started the day with finishing off the Movies & TV Shows that I'd transferred onto the external HDD overnight. Faffed about with the folder hierarchy and renamed a few files for the sake of consistency, then imported them all into my iTunes library. Scratched that itch - now back to the website!!</p>
	<p>> Investigated why the selectmenus that are embedded in the tab panels are not working correctly, when they DO work on the mobile version. Deduced that it may well have something to do with the selectmenu [as part of a file pulled in with PHP include() to save duplication] being called twice, and it only working the first time due to referencing #IDs. That being the case, I am looking at alternative ways of selecting sub-sections on larger screens. Spent a little time besides that tweaking some Bootstrap/CSS to improve - and make consistent - the look of the BOINC- and home- pages.</p>
	<p>> Spent a few hours trying to get the navigation tabs to display a sub-menu when clicked/hovered over, to enable the user to select a sub-section for look at. Was able to embed a menu within the tabs, so that a little right chevron is visible which expands with the available choices, as below:</p>
	<p><img src="images/20160608_img1.jpg" alt="Vertical Tab Menus" style="border: thin yellow solid; width: 100%; max-width: 799px;"/></p>
	<p>> However, due to the way that the jQuery function adds additional classes and numerically increasing ID's for the tab panels I couldn't find a way of getting the menu items to work as desired i.e. display the intended sub-section. A bit annoying as it feels like I'm so close with it, but I have another solution [accordion] that I'll try instead.</p>
	<p>> OK, so a few hours later, I've undone all the changes that I'd made in trying to implement the Vertical Tab Menus and added the code for the "accordion" jQuery function. Couple of issues to begin with getting it to work but researched on StackOverflow etc for similar problem and found a solution.</p>
	<p>> Whilst functional and working nicely, there was some work to do on the CSS. The colour of plain text and anchors, and the background colour all needed adjusted for content within the accordion structure. Was really starting to get a little peeved at the amount of !important CSS adjustments I was having to put in to override all the standard Bootstrap and jQuery configurations - especially when trying to dynamically change the text & background colours as the user hovers/clicks around the page. The CSS and JavaScript was beginning to get incredibly messy and confusing to keep track of what changed what.</p>
	<p>> Decided enough was enough! Made my way systematically through the various page elements to comment-out all my colour overrides and see what the "natural" jQuery/Bootstrap colour-scheme is. Located where in the minified documents they were coming from and commented THOSE out so that on page load the default colour-schemes for my site are intact.</p>
	<p>> Now just in the process of systematically re-introducing all the CSS/jQuery stuff to the correct .classes to get the effects that I want without needing to keep using the !important parameter.</p>

	<p>> Completed adding the content to the BOINC section. Happy with this - the jQuery vertical tabs are working very nicely. Spent a little time looking into how to animate the show() for the tabs to match the effect that I'd programmed myself in JavaScript for other pages (home, astropics, sepsis). The animation seemed a little clunky with the vertical tabs tbh and didn't look quite as nice, so removed the animation code.</p>
	<p>> On reflection, the standard vertical tabs DO work ever so nicely, and having the tabs open up instantly rather than through an animated effect does give a better user experience I think! The point of loading everything on the page initially is so that there are no further time-costly requests as you navigate to different sections, so it really defeats the object when you're waiting around for an animation to display a section that has been selected - even if it only 1,000 milliseconds (or whatever I choose the setting to be). So I've decided that I'll convert these other pages to using the vertical tabs without any animation effects. This also has the advantage of solving a few other niggles:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Upon loading some of the pages - the Home page especially - there is a delay of 500 - 1,000ms whilst the CSS & jQuery sorts out which sections should be visible/hidden, and there is a noticeable period where all the sections can be seen overlaid atop one another. U-G-L-Y! Converting this to vertical tabs will hopefully speed this up and remove this unwanted effect.</li>
		<li>Should hopefully resolve the issue with the "Music" sub-section of "Hobbies & Interests" not displaying the background correctly on mobile devices since the content is too large. The vertical tabs seem to do a pretty good [read: better!] job at adjusting the page background image & gradient on the fly as different tabs are selected - but then if I wasn't trying to animate it I wouldn't have had all these issues in the first place! #fml</li>
		<li>Will remove the need for a secondary Burger Menu on mobile screens - better navigation and cleaner transition between sections.</li>
		<li>Will substantially reduce the main JavaScript filesize - therefore marginally reducing the load times albeit probably imperceptibly.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>> Made good headway with converting the Homepage to use the vertical tabs rather than my previous jQuery animation method. Lots of .classes and #IDs to unpick from the CSS & JavaScript. Got it to a point where it is working well on mobile screens (where tabs are replaced with selectmenus), but having issues on larger screens where a selectmenu doesn't seem to embed very well into the tabs.</p>
	<p>> Didn't really have time to work through this fully - got quite distracted with the arrival of a new 3TB external hard drive that I'd ordered yesterday. Intention was to hook it up to my Apple Airport Extreme Base Station and use as a network drive for backups and media storage, but after a few failed attempts realised that the file format [NTFS] was incompatible with the AEBS. Was able to format to FAT-32, which works with both Apple AND Windows, but it didn't work too well. Was surprised actually that I managed to format a 3TB drive at all in that format! Transferring small files to the drive seemed to work OK, but larger files e.g. the movies that the drive was intended for just hung. Gave the AEBS up as a crap idea, re-formatted the drive as NTFS and connected directly to my PC. Transferred lots of movies & TV shows that I've previously ripped from DVDs, added to iTunes library and shared across the LAN for the Apple TVs to pick up. Have more files to transfer from another laptop but the concept is sound.</p>
	<p>> Had a bit of time in the evening to transfer the remaining video files from the other laptop. The data transfer rate seemed disappointingly low, only ~20MB/s. Figured this laptop perhaps didn't have as good a USB speed - to transfer the 400GB+ of files was going to take 6 hours!</p>
	<p>> Wondered if it would be quicker to transfer the files over the Ethernet to a different computer, then use a faster USB connexion to get the files onto the HDD. Wasn't sure of the capability of the laptop's internal Ethernet connexion - if it would do 1Gbps it might be worth a go. If it was running Windows 7 I'd just check the speed on the Networking tab of the Task Manager, but Windows 10 doesn't seem to have an easy and obvious way of getting this information! Thought a quick way to check would be to just transfer a couple of files and monitor how much of the available 1Gbps bandwidth was being used. But NO! The laptop was just not playing nicely for me at all - any time I tried to do anything with accessing the LAN or set a folder up for sharing it just kept hanging. So I could neither "push" some files from the laptop onto my desktop PC, nor access a folder from the PC to "pull" anything from the laptop. Driving me crackers!!</p>
	<p>> Eventually managed to get a laptop folder shared on the LAN after doing a full restart, and upon measuring the data throughput found it was only around half what it was doing through the USB: ~10MB/s. So that answers the question about the Ethernet capability on the laptop: 100Mbps - too slow to be of benefit. So I resumed copying the files over using the USB like I was doing to begin with, and left it to copy overnight. Such fun!! In any case, I wouldn't have done anything further with the files until the morning and it should be done by then.</p>

	<p>> Added content to the BOINC page, and added some CSS with @media queries to ensure the tab navigation and tab panels appear correctly for different screen sizes. Still more BOINC content to add - works ongoing!</p>

	<p>> Back on it briefly after a few days off!</p>
	<p>> First thing, made sure this Blog was up to date with the work I'd done last Thursday & Friday. Had been working on the code right up until the last minute to test different CSS configurations and not allowed time to add Blog updates.</p>
	<p>> Added a few new issues on GitHub for things that I'd been thinking about. Some minor, some major, but always good to jot them down to ensure they are not forgotten either way.</p>
	<p>> Had a little bit of time to finish sorting out the text & background colour of the vertical nav menu on the BOINC page. Made the last of the necessary adjustments in CSS and in JavaScript/jQuery to ensure the desired colours on page load, hover, mouseout.</p>
