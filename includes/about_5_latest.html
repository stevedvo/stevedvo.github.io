	<h4>29 March 2017</h4>
	<p>> Was awake very early this morning and not able to get back to sleep, so decided to get up, make a large mug of coffee, and scratch the itch that is the 'un-optimised images' that is affecting my website's PageSpeed Insights score. Set myself the task of looking into each of the images that PageSpeed Insights is reporting needs compressing/resizing: about a dozen in total. Opened them up Photoshop, resized to the max they would ever need to be, resaved the JPGs at a lower quality level [with very little noticeable effect], then re-tinified them on <a href="https://tinypng.com/" target="_blank">TinyPNG</a>. Committed changes to my repo, then SSH'd into the server and pulled the changes onto the live site. Result is that my PageSpeed score has now increased from 72 all the way up to around 96!! Yippee! Very happy with my mornings work :D :D</p>

	<h4>27 March 2017</h4>
	<p>> I am really enjoying cracking through my latest project at work. Using the Advanced Custom Fields plug-in, I have been putting together lots of Flexible Content layouts, and for content which is very similar I am thinking a lot about how I can put together the PHP templates in a clever way to avoid excess code duplication.</p>
	<p>> For example, where there are 1-, 2-, and 3-column layouts, I created functions to output an image content-type and a text content-type [as per the 1-column layout], then for each column I am populating a multidimensional associative array with all the info from the ACFs and then passing this array into the function to spit out the image/text specific to that column. For each of the 2- and 3- column templates I am using a 'for...' loop to spin through each column to further reduce code duplication. The function that these fields get passed into ascertains what the content-type is, and then passes the appropriate sub-array of fields into the image/text functions. Seemed to me to be awfully clever stuff and it works beautifully - very happy with the few hours of work this morning. I'm sure there are further efficiencies to be made, too - and probably involving using OOP to create a 'column' class with appropriate methods, or something... but the project DOES have a deadline and I can't spend too much time experimenting with stuff as much as I'd like to!</p>

	<h4>25 March 2017</h4>
	<p>> Tried to apply what I'd learned the other day about Git deployments to WPEngine installs. There is a facility to enable Git Push to any install, and I spent a few hours faffing about with that to get a feel for how it works. Unfortunately I don't think that it will really work that well. One issue is that any changes made over SFTP would not be tracked. In an ideal world this wouldn't be an issue, but after handing sites over to clients - or just for small tweaks [e.g. CSS] done by others - it is unfortunately not uncommon for some changes to be made directly to the files on the server and therefore not properly covered in source/version control.</p>
	<p>> Another issue is that there are certain folders & filetypes that are automatically added to a .gitignore file. A couple of folders that contain WPEngine-specific files I can understand, but also the Uploads folder and large file types are in there, which is not much good when I usually keep a complete site backup in BitBucket. I tried to remove some entries from the .gitignore file but it would seem that when then doing a Git Push it will always fail some sort of WPEnginge validation, so in my opinion the usefulness of this feature is rather limited.</p>
	<p>> Looking into my own website once again, I decided to have a go at resolving the 'Leverage Browser Caching' recommendation. And once again, now that I have access to the server configuration I was able to actually make some useful changes to this. Googled to find some relevant articles with some useful suggestions as to what lines of code I need to add to the nginx config file, and managed to get the caching working quite well. More positive increases on the PageSpeed Insights, thank you very much :D</p>

	<h4>21 March 2017</h4>
	<p>> Nice little play this evening figuring out how to deploy changes to my website using Git rather than FTP/FileZilla. Another advantage of having a decent customisable server hosting the site. I pretty much had the idea figured out in my head: basically push the changes to my GitHub repo [as I would do anyway], then SSH into the server and do a Git Pull.</p>
	<p>> It was just getting the thing set up in the first place that was a little bit tricky, but with a little bit of help from Google and my bro, I learned some new things about SSH keys and AgentForwarding and eventually got it working as I wanted. It's really nice being able to track changes and deploy in this way - seems much better than the old FTP/FileZilla method which is rather old-hat!</p>

	<h4>20 March 2017</h4>
	<p>> Starting a new big project at work today, which I have been looking forward to. It's a WordPress build, and tbh it doesn't look that complicated, but the client is very keen for this site to have a very 'high-end' feel to it: lots of cool little animation effects and jazzy stuff.</p>
	<p>> Gathered together all the extra info and comms and designs etc that had come in on Friday and had a good few hours poring over it all to make a plan of what layouts I would need to create with the Flexible ACF Content, what page templates I would need to work on, what Custom Post Types and Taxonomies I'd need to create, etc.</p>
	<p>> Created a BitBucket repo for the project, and since this company has an existing site hosted with us on WPEngine I created branches for the LIVE and STAGING environments and backed each up in their current state with the initial commits. Used the WPEngine function to copy the LIVE environment directly into STAGING, and was a little bit annoyed to find that the STAGING site would not actually work. It was due to a fatal PHP error relating to trying to instantiate the class Memcache which wasn't being declared. Great! Set up a local dev environment and found the same issue, and after a bit of Googling I managed to figure out the cause and resolve the problem.</p>
	<p>> Made a start on the actual development: created the page structure and menus, then moved onto making a start on the ACFs and putting together the first few Flexible layouts.</p>

	<h4>15 March 2017</h4>
	<p>> Attended a talk with <a href="https://www.meetup.com/PHP-Berkshire/" target="_blank">PHP Berkshire</a> this evening - the topic was of particular interest considering the work that I am currently involved in: "WordPress as a 12 Factor Application" presented by <a href="https://twitter.com/mheap" target="_blank">Michael Heap</a>. Thought it was very interesting - in the first place understanding what a 12-Factor Application actually is, and then how to apply the methodology to the way that WordPress builds are implemented. Slides of this talk can be found <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/mheap/wordpress-as-a-12-factor-app-midwest-php-2017" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
	<p>> Didn't get home until around 22:00, but I was in the mood for doing something with my website so stayed up a little late havinag a good faff. Quite optimistic that I'll be able to make good improvements to the site speed now that I have transferred away from 123-Reg over onto a new server. According to PageSpeed Insights my site was scoring a measly ~30 out of 100. Attempted previously to effect the changes that Google was recommending to improve on this but could never get any sensible access to the servers to make the required configuration tweaks.</p>
	<p>> Case in point: enabling gzip compression. This is something I got in touch with 123-Reg support about several months ago and they were less than helpful. Now, however, it only took a little bit of Googling to see how to configure an nginx server to enable gzip, add the required lines of code and restart the server and it is done! PageSpeed score straight away boosted up to 60/100 - but still room for improvement, of course.</p>
	<p>> Encouraged by the progress I was making I stayed up later still to tackle the next recommendation: optimising images. I'd learned at work to always push images through <a href="https://tinypng.com/" target="_blank">TinyPNG</a> before uploading them to the WordPress sites I am working on, so I thought that that should definitely be at least the first step. Had around 190 images to tinify so I quickly blitzed through them in batches of 20 and replaced the original image files with the new ones.</p>
	<p>> Refreshed the PageSpeed stats, and the score was increased to 68/100. I was a little bit disappointed with that, tbh! Hoping for a better increase, but looking into the recommendations there are several images which could use more optimisation: some resizing and further compression required. It really was getting late by this time so will get onto this another day!</p>

	<h4>14 March 2017</h4>
	<p>> Learned something new [or something really old!] today... had downloaded a copy of a site for a new mini project and ran into various PHP errors when trying to execute the code. The problem was that there was a lot of <code>&lt;?</code> and <code>&lt;?=</code> statements in the code, which I learned were short_code variations of <code>&lt;?php</code> and <code>&lt;?php echo</code>. The former required a minor change to my php.ini to process correctly, and the latter I have been using straight away as a nice little shorthand. Working with WordPress and spitting out the contents of Advanced Custom Fields I tend to use <code>&lt;?php echo</code> A LOT!! - so I quite like this :D</p>
	<p>> That was a good positive part of the day, but the rest of it was hard-going - one of those where I have got my head into some new code and I'm trying to work my way through it to understand how it works [on this occasion with integration with SagePay] and how to code bug fixes / new features.</p>
	<p>> At home this evening I made the switch away from 123-Reg hosting over to the new server. Connected to the new server with a key file using FileZilla and set the files copying across. It was ever so slow - network traffic only ~80kbps... then I realised that every single file operation was failing due to not having write permissions on the folder! So I had to SSH into the terminal and run a few 'sudo' commands to sort out the permissions on the appropriate files/folders. The file transfers much quicker after that!</p>
	<p>> Created a new nginx conf file for my website configuration/settings - using an existing one for another site as a template - and then amended the DNS records on my 123-Reg account and bish-bash-bosh the site transfer is sorted. Confirmed the site works on the new IP by adding an entry to my hosts file, but still waiting for the DNS updates to propagate. Woop!</p>

	<h4>13 March 2017</h4>
	<p>> The last few days at work have mostly been tackling little issues/bugs/enhancements with either new or existing sites: some things fairly easy, some things taking a little time to wrap my head around and figure out. A particularly satisfying win today came in-between tasks as I was playing around with my Git / BitBucket settings.</p>
	<p>> In a nutshell, ever since I started work here I have always connected to our BitBucket repositories over HTTPS - which has meant that every time I do a 'git pull' or a 'git push' I have had to input my password for authentication. This gets really tiresome really quickly!</p>
	<p>> In the process of moving my website to different hosting [finally moving away from the pathetically slow 123-Reg hosting - yay!] I have been reading up a bit more about making an SSH terminal connexion, SSH private & public key pairs, etc. When I first started work here I tried to sort this out using the BitBucket tutorials but could never get it working right. Now, however, my bro has sent me <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/" target="_blank">a link</a> which explains everything much more clearly and I have successfully set my machine up to use the SSH keys and changed the remote URL to the SSH version. Now all the pulling & pushing with the remote is authenticated by the SSH keys and no more passwords required. Hurrah!</p>

	<h4>08 March 2017</h4>
	<p>> Have had my eye on local PHP groups for the last couple of weeks. I used to attend the occasional <a href="https://phpminds.org/" target="_blank">php[MiNDS]</a> talks when I worked with DVO Media, but haven't been to anything since I moved further south. Found a couple of local-ish groups that meet in Bristol and Reading, which aren't exactly on my doorstep but are close enough to home and work (respectively) to be feasible.</p>
	<p>> The Bristol talks [with <a href="http://phpsw.uk/" target="_blank">PHP South West</a>] were scheduled for this evening so I decided I'd better register with <a href="https://www.meetup.com/" target="_blank">meetup.com</a> and join the group so they can manage the numbers.</p>
	<p>> Just about made it on time after leaving work and driving the hour or so to Bristol to park up and find the place. The talks this evening were:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/Brunty/bdd-behat-72979884" target="_blank">Behaviour Driven Development</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/Brunty" target="_blank">Matt Brunt</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://slides.com/tomadam/remote-debugging-with-xdebug#/" target="_blank">Remote Debugging with XDebug</a> by Tom Adam</li>
	</ul>
	<p>> Both talks were very interesting, especially the first. The XDebug talk was a good refresher of some things that I learned whilst at DVO Media, however I have still yet to actually use it properly in my development - I still var_dump and exit - but I really ought to make use of this powerful tool.</p>

	<h4>07 March 2017</h4>
	<p>> Had a little bit of 'free' time today in-between projects, which I made good use of: set up a local WordPress instance to practice working with Advanced Custom Fields - specifically investigating how to make use of certain field types that I haven't used before/much: 'Gallery', 'Embed', 'Date/Time Picker', 'Flexible Content', 'Google Map'.</p>
	<p>> Spent a little while playing around with the Google Map field type - grabbed some code from the ACF documentation and used it to display a map on the front end with markers placed at specified places. The JavaScript calculates the map centre and zoom level based upon the markers specified. Also, using methods learned from another project, figured out how to give each of the markers a custom map pin icon.</p>
	<p>> Quite a nice useful couple of hours of self-teaching :)</p>
