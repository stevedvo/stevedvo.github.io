	<h4>24 November 2016</h4>
	<p>> The Joomla site that I've been spending time on recently is running quite an old version of the CMS - there are several security updates / patches that it really could do with getting installed on it. To have a practice run I tried updating the version of the site on my local dev machine, but try as I might it just would not have it whichever way I attempted it!</p>
	<p>> Spun up a duplicate Droplet on Digital Ocean to practice on to see if that helped. The good news was that it got a little further with it - and I'm glad of taking the precautions of doing this on a dev Droplet as it was not all plain-sailing! There were a couple of little issues to resolve: firstly getting the configuration file set up to point to the correct log & tmp directories; then once the update had taken place amending one of the php files that was calling a particular function twice and causing a HTTP 500 error on the front end.</p>
	<p>> With a bit of faffing I got the front end back up, and put through some test transactions to confirm all was behaving as it should. Callback working. E-mail working [for now, although it may trigger Spamhaus to blacklist it again]. Only issues as far as I can see is that one of the extensions cannot be accessed as it is HTTP500-ing on the backend. An upgrade my resolve it, but it's a paid-for extension I need login credentials for the site that I can download it from - and the client may not actually be all that fussed about it in any case.</p>

	<h4>23 November 2016</h4>
	<p>> Did a little tweaking with my home WAMPServer this morning: I was having difficulty connecting to it from any other computer other than the host. With the help of a little Googling I figured out why I couldn't connect to it with my laptop over the LAN: a combination of Firewall and Apache rules. Got the connexion sorted after a bit of trial & error, then imported the DB for the site I was previously hosting on my laptop and ensured the the site files were on my PC and up to date by pulling it from my Git repo. Little bit of further tweaking of the hosts and Apache vhosts files on my PC to give a convenient name to the site - and a nice little PHP script to redirect to the correct homepage and it was all done just in time to leave for work.</p>
	<p>> More issues with the Joomla site at work, this morning: the e-mails were now not working for some reason. They WERE working yesterday afternoon, but then they had stopped working. Initial thought was to check the 'invoices' directory still had the 777 permissions that we'd set yesterday which ultimately fixed the major callback issue. But that was still all fine, and I could see that invoices were still being generated correctly. Next thought was that the e-mails were getting picked up as spam and Spamhaus had blocked them. I was correct! Didn't take much looking into the logs to confirm, and Spamhaus had it listed just as my dev site was a couple of days ago. Easy to delist and get the mails working again temporarily, but some part of the config needs changing to ensure it doesn't keep happening and Spamhaus don't block it for good!</p>
	<p>> Did some work to add content to the EpiServer site that I'd looked at initially yesterday. It's not too difficult to work with, but having issues with the styling: I don't seem to have any access to the main CSS file(s) - so whilst I could put in some in-line CSS for specific bits of content, there are other things [such as sizes/positions of containing div elements] that I can't do a lot about, currently. Also had some "fun" trying to figure out how to a display a video on the site: seems to not be a simple case of just uploading a video and referencing the filepath: that would be TOO EASY, of course! Taking clues from other videos already on the site, it seems I need to reference a ContentID on Ooyala which would host the video. Why can things not be simple?</p>
	<p>> The last little point of learning today is that IE is absolutely shockingly bad at rendering images! A site which looked fine on Chrome & Firefox looked horrible on IE due to the images being all grainy and rubbish. The images WERE rather on the large side, which not only put the onus of resizing on the browser, but of course also increased the file download size. So I had a whizz through the site and optimised all the images that IE was struggling with.</p>

	<h4>22 November 2016</h4>
	<p>> Back on the Joomla site at work this morning, and for some reason the dev site on the clone droplet wasn't working with processing the payments & doing the e-mails - which was more than slightly annoying since it worked yesterday!! Had a feeling it might have had something to do with changing the file/folder permissions just before leaving, but after changing them all back it still wasn't working. Looked into all the log files I could find to try and trace what was going on with Apache, mail, MySQL, etc, etc. After a bit of digging, and clearing the logs to make the next attempt easier to to track, I had another go. And woudl you believe it - it just worked this time without actually changing anything else! Wonder if there was some caching going on or something?</p>
	<p>> I reasoned that the change of permissions probably DID have an effect but just not as instantly as I first expected. Problem was I had no idea which of the 20,000 files/folders was actually causing the issue, and I didn't like to change all the permissions on the proper live site to something less secure without needing to. Was able to confirm on the live site that installing sendmail had worked - I could get a PHP script to run and send me a test e-mail when I wanted. And I could see in the Joomla backend that genuine bookings were able to be made... so the next step was to put through another test transaction on the live site to verify that all was good. It was not... it got stuck at the Worldpay payment authorisation screen again! Gah! Lots of Googling didn't help to narrow down which file permissions needed changing, but we had a hunch that it might be related to the generation of invoice PDFs. We set the folder permissions on that to 777 and hey presto it solved the issue! Very annoying!! Shouldn't have to keep faffing about the file & folder permissions like this - especially if it means making things so insecure with 777 settings! But the good news is that the whole process seems to be working as it should now: the user gets redirected to the callback URL and receives the correct e-mail confirmation. MVP: get the thing working, then sort out the detail later!</p>
	<p>> Did some work today on a site which required me install NodeJS, npm, gulp & bower in order to be able to host a version of it locally. I've installed these utilities on a dev machine before, but I always find it troublesome - I think mainly because I am taking instruction from other people who kind of know what they are doing, but not exactly: so it's like "type this command", then "type that command", "oh no, wait, you need to type this command first". It would be more helpful to understand WHAT the commands are doing and WHY they need running in a particular order, rather than just muddling along until it works. I have no doubt that these are excellent utilities - otherwise they wouldn't be so popular - I just need to find some proper tutorials and learn about them properly.</p>
	<p>> Another site I started some work on today was using a CMS that I wasn't familiar with: EpiServer. Having a dig around the backend it seems reasonably logical, although a bit limited - this is probably more due to the privileges granted on the user account than an issue with the CMS per s√©.</p>

	<h4>21 November 2016</h4>
	<p>> Bit of fun at home: set my main PC to have a static IP address rather than being set by DHCP, and installed WAMPServer so that I can use that as a main local webhost. Have a couple of PHP-based web apps that would be useful to access frequently, but it's just a pest that I'd only gotten WAMPServer on my laptop for dev work, and the IP address was dynamic depending on which wi-fi network it connected to. Felt like a good move to use the main desktop PC as the server and get the IP address fixed.</p>
	<p>> Back at work I turned my attention again to the Joomla site, and the payment processing issues. Problem was that the payment process wasn't working properly when somebody makes a purchase. Spent ages digging around the various PHP files trying to understand what was going on, and putting through dummy transactions on my local machine and the live site, but just couldn't see why the POST info wasn't coming through, or what the other issue(s) were. After a few hours we decided to create a new Digital Ocean droplet and have a proper live site site to work with - the lack of admin privileges on the actual live site, and the lack of proper live connexion on my local setup, were hindering the investigation.</p>
	<p>> Fairly soon after setting up the cloned droplet I was able to find a way of getting the callback URL to function, and the payment confirmation page came up. Only thing was that the e-mail confirmations were not coming through... so I spent more time digging into the code again to try and figure out what was supposed to be firing the e-mail off. After some investigation I realised that the site was set up to use PHP mail but the error logs were showing that something was trying to use sendmail. Once fairly confident that that seemed to be the issue, found the commands to punch into the PuTTY console and install sendmail, and then configure it so it works quickly. Got it working OK on the clone droplet, but it was getting late so had to park that until tomorrow.</p>

	<p>> The Joomla site continues to stay alive under cover of Cloudflare, but had a couple of things to look at today: one was that the Joomla instance [and several plug-ins / components] need updating; and the other was an issue that seemed to be cropping up that was preventing payments being made. Spent some time looking into these but unfortunately didn't get very far! My local copy of the site would not update at all, and I'm not sure yet why, and despite trying to follow the PHP code behind the payment system I was unable to replicate the reported error.</p>

	<h4>17 November 2016</h4>
	<p>> The Joomla site that we'd re-instated had gone down again - actually quite soon after completing the work previously! Despite being on a new IP address, the site was continuing to get hammered with DDoS traffic. We spun up yet another Droplet with yet another IP address with which to host the site - but THIS time we also routed the site through <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a>. Initially set up with the default security level, within 5-10 mins of getting the site up & running again the DDoS attack resumed, but then we "raised the shields" and activated Cloudflare's "I'm under attack!" mode. Extremely satisfying to be able to see all the traffic that Cloudflare was effortlessly dealing with [circa 7 million hits in the space of 90 mins!] by serving a cached version of the site, whilst allowing the site to still function properly. After a few hours of this the DDoS attack stopped: not sure who initiated it or why, but they obviously got bored once they realised they were no longer having an effect.</p>

	<h4>15 November 2016</h4>
	<p>> Had a little task today for a website where it was reported that certain keyword searches on Google were coming up with the wrong page title in the search results, but only when doing the search on a tablet device. Spent a little while putting together a testing matrix: trying various keyword searches on different platforms and found that Google does indeed sometimes use a different page title in the search result, but in researching how I can change this it seems that it is something completely outside of our control!</p>
	<p>> A high priority task came my way too, today: a website that was under a targeted DDoS attack needed help! We had been given a DB dump and FTP zip of the Joomla site to try and get it working temporarily on another host. I first of all set my machine up to run a local version of it - to check first of all that we had all the files & data required, and what the site was supposed to look like. Then we spun up a box on Digital Ocean to host the site. Got as far as doing the FTP transfer and importing the DB, but encountered difficulties in getting the site to run. After some investigation, realised that the version of PHP on the LAMP Droplet instance was too high for the version of Joomla that the site was running on; and the version of Ubuntu wouldn't accept an earlier version of PHP! So that Droplet was canned and I spun up a new one with an earlier version of Ubuntu. A little bit of work involved in getting myself more familiar with the Ubuntu command line for file operations and server commands, importing MySQL databases on the command line, manipulating permissions. Got the site running in the end - hurrah!</p>

	<h4>11 November 2016</h4>
	<p>> Long afternoon trying to sort out some JavaScript / jQuery bugs. Working on a site where there are containers containing images, which have an overlay appearing on hover and link to other pages on the site on click. On a desktop this works fine, but I spent a long time trying to figure out a solution that works well on mobile/touchscreens - once problem is that since the images are full width on mobile, when trying to scroll down the page the finger touch is picked up as a click. Trying to resolve that resulted in another problem and I seemed to be going round in circles for hours! :(</p>

	<h4>07 November 2016</h4>
	<p>> Had a productive morning tinkering with my computer installing the new RAM modules that had arrived at the weekend. Swapped out the DIMMs in banks 2 & 4 to begin with, and booted up to check that the BIOS recognised the new sticks - just in case there were any compatibility problems at all. It booted up and I got into the BIOS to confirm the memory was recognised, no problem. So shut down again and replaced the DIMMs in banks 1 & 3. Powered on, booted up, and hey presto! - 8GB of RAM installed. Woop woop! Didn't take long at all - the most time taken being in unplugging all the devices from the back of the computer, plugging them all back in again, and getting the case back on!</p>
	<p>> Good day at work, too, getting more familiar with WordPress and Photoshop as I work on various projects.</p>
