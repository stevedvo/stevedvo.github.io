<p>I first started watching F1 when I was only in single-digits. I wasn't an avid fan back then, but I remember watching races going back as far as 1988-1989. This was a time of McLaren-Honda dominance, and drivers such as Senna, Prost, Mansell, Piquet, Alesi, Berger & Patrese were behind the wheel.</p>
<p>It was only a casual interest which waned after a couple of seasons - probably barely watching any of it for several years from 1991 onwards. Looking back now I think this was a shame since there was so much that I totally missed, e.g. Mansell's dominant World Championship victory in 1992, Schumacher's introduction and meteoric rise to the top - as well as the early F1 careers of other future front-runners such as Damon Hill, Hakkinen & Villeneuve, and the dark weekend at Imola in 1994.</p>
<p>It wasn't until 1998-1999 that I began to take an interest in the sport again, and this time I was much keener! There were several years where I watched almost every qualifying and race session live - even if that meant getting up at 04:00 sometimes - and more often than not I would have the Live Timings screen open to watch the lap and sector times as well as all sorts of extra info. I saw Hakkinen win at least one of his championships, with stiff competition from Schumacher and an improving Ferrari team - which they then of course proceeded with record-breaking domination in the early 2000's.</p>
<p>My interest was further enhanced by my studies of fluid mechanics, differential equations and optimisation at university. I became fascinated with understanding the strategies that each team employed with pit stops for new tyres and fuel to optimise their races. I understand the complaints that the sport is constantly getting about it not being as exciting / not enough overtaking / too processional / etc., and whilst I love to see good on-track action as much as anybody this is only part of what I enjoy about the sport.</p>
<p>It was great news when the BBC started showing F1 again, after ITV had had the rights for a number of years - and I think it's quite sad that the BBC then gave it up gradually. Now the only option to watch it on terrestrial television is on a channel with commercials, and only half the sessions broadcast live. To watch everything live on tv now requires a subscription to a Sky channel - and even the Live Timing screens are limited if you don't cough up some extra dough. Kind of a shame that things have gone this way, but on the other hand it is quite liberating getting several hours back each race weekend by not watching it too intensively!</p>
