	<p style="margin-top: 10px;">RAISE AWARENESS: First and foremost, raising awareness of the condition amongst the general public and medical professionals alike.</p>
	<p>SAVE LIVES: Once sepsis is accepted as a medical emergency and as a clinical priority for the NHS, it is estimated that up to 13,500 lives could be saved each year.</p>
	<p>SAVE MONEY: The sooner the symptoms are recognised, the sooner the patient can be admitted to hospital, the sooner the patient can be treated, and the less sick they are likely to become. Time is of the essence, and time = money! A sicker patient needs more staff care, more food, more fluids, and takes up a bed in a hospital which could already be struggling for space.</p>
