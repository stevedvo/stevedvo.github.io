	<p>Milkyway@Home uses the BOINC platform to harness volunteered computing resources, creating a highly accurate three dimensional model of the Milky Way galaxy using data gathered by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. This project enables research in both astroinformatics and computer science.</p>
	<p>In computer science, the project is investigating different optimization methods which are resilient to the fault-prone, heterogeneous and asynchronous nature of Internet computing; such as evolutionary and genetic algorithms, as well as asynchronous newton methods. While in astroinformatics, Milkyway@Home is generating highly accurate three dimensional models of the Sagittarius stream, which provides knowledge about how the Milky Way galaxy was formed and how tidal tails are created when galaxies merge.</p>
	<p>Milkyway@Home studies the history of our galaxy by analysing the stars in the Milky Way galaxy's Galactic Halo. This includes searching for elusive dark matter. This research is done by mapping structures of stars orbiting the Milky Way - many of these structures are actually "tidal debris streams", or dwarf galaxies that are being pulled apart by our Galaxy's superior gravitational field. The orbits, shapes, and compositions of these dwarf galaxies provide vital clues to the history of our Galaxy, as well as to the distribution of dark matter.</p>
	<p>Additionally, Milkyway@Home has recently started developing the "N-body" sub-project, which creates simulated dwarf galaxies and "shoots" them into the Milky Way's gravitational field. The simulated dwarf galaxy's initial conditions are varied until the final simulated dwarf matches what we see in actual halo structures i.e. the project is trying to match dwarf galaxy models to real data, in order to learn more about what is (and what isn't) possible for our Galaxy.</p>
	<p>Until the late 1990's, the Galactic halo was thought to be smooth and uninteresting, but Heidi Newberg's 2002 paper ("The Ghost of Sagittarius and Lumps in the Halo of the Milky Way") proved that the halo is actually full of these tidal debris (the halo is "lumpy"). Since then, astronomers have been actively searching for and characterising these structures. So Milkyway@Home is doing cutting-edge astronomy in a field which is only around 15 years old!</p>
	<p>Background information: The Milky Way</p>
	<p>The Milky Way is our home galaxy, one of BILLIONS of known galaxies in the Universe. In addition to our Sun, the Milky Way contains around 400 billion other stars - that's about 57 stars for every human being alive on Earth today! Even though that sounds big, the Milky Way is actually thought to be an average-sized galaxy.</p>
	<p>The Milky Way is currently understood to be a barred spiral galaxy (Hubble type SBbc) that is 100,000 light-years across - that is, it takes 100,000 years for light (the fastest thing known to exist) to travel from one end of the Milky Way to the other. For comparison, light takes 8 minutes to get from the Sun to the Earth. While the light-year is a physically useful unit, astronomers tend to use "parsecs" when measuring distances. A parsec (short for "parallax-second") is 3.26 light-years, and is related to one of the most precise methods of determining distances to other stars ("parallax"). In Galactic astronomy, we work with truly astronomical distances, so we use "kiloparsecs" (kpc), or thousands of parsecs, as our distance units. The radius of the Milky Way, then, is 15 kpc, with our Sun being 8 kpc from the centre of the galaxy.</p>
	<p>The modern view of the Milky Way galaxy contains four major components: The disk, bulge, stellar halo, and dark matter halo. The disk is the most obvious component of the galaxy, and is considered to consist of two parts: the thin disk and the thick disk. The thin disk is about 0.3 kpc thick and contains almost all of the dust, gas, and young stars (including the Sun) in our Galaxy. The thick disk is about 1 kpc thick, and marks the thickness where star densities drop dramatically.</p>
	<p>The bulge lies at the centre of the disk, has a radius of only a few kpc, and contains both old and young stars. Recently, it was determined that the bulge contains a prominent bar. Additionally, a super massive black hole resides at the centre of the galaxy - with a mass equal to that of 4 million Suns!</p>
	<p>The stellar halo is a nearly spherical spheroid of stars that surrounds the entire galaxy. The density of stars in the halo is very low compared to densities found in the disk, and the majority of halo stars are found within 30 kpc of the galactic centre. The stellar halo is the focus of Milkyway@Home.</p>
	<p>The dark matter halo is the most mysterious of all the galactic components. Information from galactic rotation curves, galaxy collisions, and dark matter simulations all strongly indicate that there is a large amount of invisible mass surrounding every galaxy. Modern astronomers hope to gain clues about the shape and composition of the dark matter halo from structures in the disk and stellar halo.</p>
	<p>Dark Matter is the mass that is needed to make up for the unseen mass in physical observations. Although other solutions to these discrepancies have been proposed, such as modifications to Newton's and/or Einstein's theories of gravitation, dark matter is the only solution that describes all of the observed scientific anomalies simultaneously. Therefore, understanding dark matter is currently one of the major goals of science.</p>
	<p>To understand what "dark" matter is, we need to understand "light" matter (the stuff we are used to). "Light" matter is made of baryons, which are particles that are made of quarks. The most important consequence of baryons being built of quarks is that they interact electromagnetically. This means that light, which is an electromagnetic wave, can interact with baryons. Light waves have a large variety of wavelengths that make up the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves at low frequencies/large wavelengths through to microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-Rays, and at the upper end of the frequencies (or lower end of wavelengths) are Gamma Rays. Depending on how the baryons are arranged, baryonic matter will absorb, reflect, or emit certain wavelengths of light. In fact, all baryonic matter will emit some wavelengths of light based on its temperature - stars, for example, are very hot, and so they can emit visible light. The higher an object's temperature, the shorter the wavelengths that can be emitted. Therefore, all baryonic matter "glows" at certain wavelengths (including humans! We glow in the infrared).</p>
	<p>Dark matter is different. Dark matter does not emit light at any wavelength. Dark matter does not absorb light, and it doesn't reflect it, either. Dark matter, then, does not interact electromagnetically at all. This is why it is "dark": light waves can never even know it's there.</p>
	<p>Since dark matter doesn't interact with light, the only way that we can currently study it is through gravity. By studying the distribution of baryonic matter (stars and gas) in the Milky Way, we will gain insight into the arrangement and composition of dark matter. Milkyway@Home furthers this goal by studying stars in the stellar halo, using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.</p>
