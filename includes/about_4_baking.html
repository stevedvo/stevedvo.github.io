<p>I enjoy baking. Baking is fun!</p>
<p>Everybody gotta eat, that's what cooking is for. And cooking can be fun too - putting together a tasty shepherds pie or a lasagne, for example - but baking for me is all about creating something that is naughty/superfluous to requirements. Just something sweet & tasty for a treat: cakes, scones, flapjacks, fruit pies & crumbles, other desserts & puddings.</p>
<p>Aside from the obvious pleasure of eating whatever delicious treat I have created, and seeing others enjoy the fruits of my labours, too - I think one aspect of baking that really appeals to me is the precision. It's kind of like performing a science experiment: you have to follow a list of instructions to mix the right ingredients together in the right way, apply the correct amount of heat for the correct amount of time, and if you do all of that right each time you achieve the same [hopefully optimal] result every time. Make a slight change and the results will be different, for better or worse. Was it Einstein who defined insanity as "doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result"? You don't HAVE to be that precise about everything... but the results may vary - and what's the point of trying if you're not going to try to get the best result?</p>
<p>I studied Home Economics: Cooking at GCSE. The emphasis was more on cooking in general, understanding the nutrition involved with the foods that we eat and how to plan a meal to cater for certain dietary needs. Was quite interesting, but baking the sweet goodies was without a doubt my favourite part!</p>
<p>Bread. Possibly the only non-sweet baking and staple food that I really enjoy making. Electronic breadmakers certainly bring the convenience of making home-baked bread much easier, but seriously what is the point of THAT?! The whole fun of making your own bread is in kneading & pummelling the dough yourself, not getting some machine to do it on your behalf (and often nowhere near as well). I do have to admit, however, that whenever I do bake my own bread I tend to cheat and use "just add water"-type dry packet-mixes rather than getting the delicate balance of flour, yeast, salt & sugar right myself - but the fun pummelling part is still there :D. I'm not averse to buying the separate ingredients and mixing myself - it's how we did it back in school, with live yeast no less - but the packet mixes are ever so convenient and usually provides a good tasty light loaf... unless done in a breadmaker which results in a disappointing brick, albeit tasty nonetheless.</p>
