	<p style="margin-top: 10px;">LHC@home is used to upgrade and maintain the particle accelerator Large Hadron Collider (LHC) of the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), and to simulate high-energy particle collisions to provide a reference to test the measurements performed at the LHC.</p>
	<p>The project simulates particles accelerating through the 27 km (17 mi)-long LHC to find their orbit stability. The results of this are utilized by engineers to improve the operation and efficiency of the particle accelerator, and to predict possible problems that could arise from adjustment or modification of the LHC's equipment. The project is administered by volunteers, and receives no funding from CERN. There are currently no plans to use the project to do computation on the data that will be collected by the LHC.</p>
	<p>For each workunit, 60 particles are simulated travelling 100,000 or 1,000,000 loops. That may sound like a lot, but it is less than 10 seconds in the real world. Still, it is enough to test whether the beam is going to remain on a stable orbit for a much longer time, or risks losing control and flying off course into the walls of the vacuum tube. Such a beam instability would be a very serious problem that could result in the damage to the machine and it needing to be shut down for repairs.</p>
	<p>With this project's help, the LHC beam physicists and engineers are making the adjustments needed to create cleaner, more stable and safer beams.</p>
