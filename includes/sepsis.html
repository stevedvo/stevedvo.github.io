				<hr/>

					<p>THE BIGGEST KILLER THAT NOBODY HAS HEARD OF!</p>
					<p>Sepsis accounts for 44,000 deaths annually in the UK and costs the NHS an estimated £2.5 billion. That’s more deaths than bowel cancer, breast cancer and prostate cancer put together. Patients with the most severe forms of sepsis are up to five times more likely to die than patients with a heart attack or stroke.</p>
					<p>Sepsis was previously known as septicaemia or blood poisoning and is caused by the way the body responds to germs, such as bacteria, getting into your body. Sepsis can be caused by a huge variety of different bugs, most cases being caused by common bacteria which we all come into contact with every day without them making us ill. Sometimes, though, the body responds abnormally to these infections, and causes sepsis - whereby your body attacks its own organs and tissues. The infection may have started anywhere in a sufferer’s body, and may be only in one part of the body or it may be widespread.</p>
					<p>Infections which can give rise to sepsis are common, and include lung infections (pneumonia), water infections, infections in wounds, bites or the joints, and problems like burst ulcers.</p>
					<p>Sepsis can rapidly lead to shock, multiple organ failure and death - especially if not recognized early and treated promptly. The NHS deals with over 150,000 cases of severe sepsis (sepsis with associated organ dysfunction) annually, and many more patients with sepsis (a systemic inflammatory response to an infection) which has yet to deteriorate to severe sepsis.</p>
					<p>In hospitals and long term care facilities, it’s one of the most common causes of patient deterioration; and in the community it accounts for 10-20% of adult medical emergencies. Though sepsis is common, it is poorly addressed: but the good news is that urgent basic care can make a real difference between survival and death. Patients and health workers need to work together to ensure lifesaving treatment is delivered as soon as possible.</p>

					<p>Caught early, the outlook is good for the vast majority of patients. It is crucial not to delay seeking medical attention. If you or a loved one had a suspected infection, or certain risk factors like being very young or old, diabetic, pregnant or on long-term steroids, then you would need to know what to look for.</p>
					<p>However, in the early stages it is often difficult to distinguish sepsis from 'flu. If you have recently had a fever, or have early signs of a fever or ‘flu-like illness, chest infection, diarrhoea and vomiting or inability to eat and drink, together with one of the symptoms of sepsis, DO NOT DELAY! Call 999 and say this is sepsis.</p>

					<p>If you suspect sepsis, it is imperative that the patient receives urgent medical attention. Don’t be afraid to say “I think this might be sepsis”. Remember, if it does turn out to be sepsis, getting this patient treated even one hour earlier might make the difference between life and death.</p>

					<p>CRITICAL FIRST HOUR</p>
					<p>Sepsis is an emergency, just like heart attacks and stroke. The good news is, life-saving treatment for sepsis is often relatively straightforward. International recommendations suggest that treatment should be started within one hour of sepsis being suspected. Research has shown that treatment with intravenous antibiotics and fluids works.</p>
					<p>Early recognition, and getting basic treatments including antibiotics and fluids into the patient within the first hour, can halt the progression of sepsis and hugely improve outcomes for patients. Antibiotics can cause harm if given inappropriately. Doctors should always prescribe antibiotics with caution. In the case of sepsis, however, they are the single most important lifesaving measure.</p>
					<p>The <a href="http://sepsistrust.org/" target="_blank">UK Sepsis Trust</a> recommends a set of treatments known as the ‘Sepsis Six’, which is a set of interventions that can be can be administered by junior nurses and doctors, and have been shown to double the chance of survival - especially if all carried out within the first hour of admission.</p>
					<fieldset><legend>THE SEPSIS SIX</legend>
						<ol>
							<li>Administer high flow oxygen.</li>
							<li>Take blood cultures.</li>
							<li>Give broad-spectrum antibiotics.</li>
							<li>Give intravenous fluid challenges.</li>
							<li>Measure serum lactate and haemoglobin.</li>
							<li>Measure accurate hourly urine output.</li>
						</ol>
					</fieldset>
					<p>Early intervention with the Sepsis Six certainly saves lives, but has also been shown to reduce length of hospital stay and need for Critical Care admission. Excellent news for patients, relatives, AND the strained NHS budget!</p>

				<h3 class="head3">Goals</h3>
				<hr/>
				<article>
					<p>RAISE AWARENESS: First and foremost, raising awareness of the condition amongst the general public and medical professionals alike.</p>
					<p>SAVE LIVES: Once sepsis is accepted as a medical emergency and as a clinical priority for the NHS, it is estimated that up to 13,500 lives could be saved each year.</p>
					<p>SAVE MONEY: The sooner the symptoms are recognised, the sooner the patient can be admitted to hospital, the sooner the patient can be treated, and the less sick they are likely to become. Time is of the essence, and time = money! A sicker patient needs more staff care, more food, more fluids, and takes up a bed in a hospital which could already be struggling for space.</p>
