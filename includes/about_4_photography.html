<p>A little hobby that I became interested in with the purchase of a digital camera whilst at university. I had studied optics at school and college, and understood the basic principles of how cameras worked: depth of field, f-numbers, etc., so I was keen to find a digital camera that was not a "point-and-shoot" simple one, but had full control over the aperture size, shutter speed, equivalent ISO sensitivity, and so forth.</p>
<p>Since one of the main reasons for the purchase was to use it for astronomical purposes, one of the highest considerations was that I MUST be able to open the shutter for longer than would be considered "normal" [i.e. a few seconds at most] to allow dim starlight to be collected on the CCD. I spent a little while doing research on various websites - such as <a href="http://www.dpreview.com" target="_blank">Digital Photography Review</a> - reading lots of reviews and tests, before deciding on a Nikon E4500. With a 4 megapixel CCD, 2" viewer, and an 8MB compactflash memory card, the specification now - some 15 years later - is quite laughable! But at the time - and even now - it is a very good camera. I bought an extra battery pack so I could keep snapping whilst one battery was charging, and an extra 256MB compactflash card which was priced at the going rate of Â£60!</p>
<p>For astrophotography and regular photography, I have taken a lot of enjoyment from playing with the various settings and trying to frame a picture just right to take an interesting photograph. My holiday pictures tend to feature people very little, and scenery much much more! There was a time where I would select the best of the bunch that I'd filled the memory card with, take it to ASDA to print them out, and then stick them an in album - but with the ever-improving technologies, the now ubiquitous camera-phone, and online photo albums incorporated into Facebook, I very rarely print any photographs out these days. It's probably been 10 years or more since I last did! And since iPhone cameras have come on in leaps and bounds it's quite rare that I would even dig out my digital camera. It is still used for astrophotography since I have adapters which connect it to the eyepieces for the telescope, but for normal everyday photos it is so much easier to whip the iPhone out of the pocket and snap away. Although this goes against my earlier philosophy of wanting more control over all of the settings and steering away from "point-and-shoot", I have to concede that there is something to be said for the convenience!</p>
