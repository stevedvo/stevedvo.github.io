		<p>Working as a Commercial Manager with MoD contractors for 9+ years I have honed my skills in data-analysis: my main duties involving the exporting & merging job & accounts data from a variety of bespoke software applications into Excel and producing a number of daily/weekly/monthly/ad hoc reports to monitor operational & commercial performance. I always relished the opportunity to try something new, to think about how to break down the data in different ways to measure performance and how to utilise my generated reports to optimise business processes and maximise margins.</p>
		<p>Having left the contract I'd been working on for so long I was more than ready to face some new challenges and decided to concentrate my efforts on web development. The HTML that I'd casually picked up whilst at school/college is a far cry from current technologies, and I am self-studying to improve my knowledge of - to begin with - HTML5, PHP, MySQL, JavaScript and CSS3. Putting my newfound knowledge together with my previous skills & experience I joined <a href="http://dvomedia.net" target="_blank">DVO Media</a> as Client Services Manager & Product Owner, where I gained valuable experience in Agile Software Development methodologies and development & task-management software:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Daily Scrum stand-up</li>
			<li>Backlog refinement</li>
			<li>Sprint planning and retrospective/review</li>
			<li>JIRA</li>
			<li>Trello</li>
			<li>Asana</li>
			<li>Xero</li>
			<li>Git & GitHub</li>
			<li>Sublime Text</li>
			<li>Slackware</li>
			<li>Bootstrap</li>
			<li>jQuery</li>
		</ul>
		<p>There was also ample opportunity for the whole development team to participate in additional events to further expand our knowledge and skills: attending monthly talks at a local <a href="https://phpminds.org/" target="_blank">php[Minds]</a> group, regular team Dev Lunch / knowledge share sessions, and attending the <a href="http://phpconference.co.uk/" target="_blank">2016 PHP UK Conference</a> in London.</p>
		<p>Although I've been tinkering with web development for over a year, this is my first attempt at creating my own website.</p>
