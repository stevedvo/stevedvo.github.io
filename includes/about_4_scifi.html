<p>My early interest in astronomy and the sciences pretty much fuelled my interest in science-fiction. Some of the ideas of what could be achieved/discovered in the future in terms of space exploration, extra-terrestrial biological entities and intelligent life, and the capabilities of computers and the human mind are quite profound and fascinating.</p>
<p>In the form of either a tv show, movie, magazine, or novel, a few of my favourites include: Star Trek, X-Files, Quantum Leap, Red Dwarf, Outer Limits, Tomorrow People, Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy, Star Wars, X-Men, RoboCop, Starship Troopers... the list goes on.</p>
