	<p style="margin-top: 10px;">Steve DeVeaux BSc (Hons)</p>
	<p>Spreadsheet, data and programming enthusiast.</p>
	<p>Having spent my teens in the 90's I have grown up with computers and followed with great interest the advances in technology and the emergence of the Internet. Throughout my education and employment I have used a variety of platforms: from the early days of BBC Micros, Acorns & Atari STs through to various versions of Apple & "IBM-Compatible" PCs.</p>
	<p>I have always seemed to have a natural affinity and genuine interest / curiosity in mathematics and the sciences, and this heavily influenced the choices that I made for the subjects studied at 'A'-Level and at University. At college I particularly enjoyed learning in Mathematics about calculus & and using differential equations to solve problems, and in Computing about how to break problems down into smaller chunks and create programs in pseudocode and Pascal.</p>
	<p>University was a whole extra level of fascinating material and hard work, and helped to hone my problem-solving and analytical skills - especially in using data-analysis within Excel which is how my early post-University career progressed. However, after a good number of years working with Excel and smashing together large sets of imported data from various sources to analyse operational & commercial performance, I began to crave new challenges and rather fancied getting my head back into more of a programming gear.</p>
	<p>To that end, I bought up several books on the latest versions of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP & MySQL, and eagerly made my way through them to digest as much new information as I could and build new modern webpages with a database at the backend. In time this extended to understanding how to use Bootstrap & jQuery, and how to create responsive webpages suitable for all types of device.</p>
	<p>As part of my own self-tuition I created this very website using all hand-typed code [in conjunction with open-source libraries] - which also helped me to understand and overcome various issues with Search Engine Optimisation using Google's WebMaster Tools and PageSpeed Insights.</p>
	<p>To continue to further my own development I have enrolled onto a Web Design & Development course to help fill in any gaps in my knowledge and gain an RQF Certificate - my first actual qualification in the subject.</p>
	<p>I am also looking into various JavaScript frameworks and Content Management Systems (initially WordPress). There is so much to learn, and it is a steep learning curve, but I am enjoying it.</p>
