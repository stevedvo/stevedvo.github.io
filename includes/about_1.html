	<p>Spreadsheet, data and programming enthusiast.</p>
	<p>Having spent my teens in the 90's I have grown up with computers and followed with great interest the advances in technology and the emergence of the Internet. Throughout my education and employment I have used a variety of platforms: from the early days of BBC Micros, Acorns & Atari STs through to various versions of Apple & "IBM-Compatible" PCs. For my web development I am accustomed to using both Microsoft operating systems & environments as well as Apple OS X.</p>
