	<p style="margin-top: 10px;">SETI@home searches for possible evidence of radio transmissions from extraterrestrial intelligence using observational data from the Arecibo radio telescope observatory in Puerto Rico. Constructed in a natural depression and with a dish diameter of 305m, this has been the largest radio telescope of its type for well over 50 years - a record which is due to be broken in 2016 when the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope [FAST] in China is commissioned.</p>
	<p>The observational data is taken "piggyback" or "passively" while the telescope is used for other scientific programs, and is recorded on 2-terabyte SATA hard disk drives - each holding about 2.5 days of observations, which are then sent to Berkeley. Arecibo does not have a broadband Internet connection, so data must go by snail-mail to Berkeley!! Once there, it is divided in both time and frequency domains workunits of 107 seconds of data, or approximately 350kB, which overlap in time but not in frequency. These work units are then sent from the SETI@home server over the Internet to personal computers around the world for analysis. The SETI@home application that volunteers download and operate through BOINC searches for any variations in the data which cannot be ascribed to noise, and hence contain information. The analysis software can search for signals with about one-tenth the strength of those sought in previous surveys, because it makes use of a computationally-intensive algorithm called coherent integration that no one else has had the computing power to implement. All the results - and potential signals - are then reported back to Berkeley where the data is merged into the database. Interference is rejected, and various pattern-detection algorithms are applied to search for the most interesting signals.</p>
	<p>The application searches for five types of signals that distinguish them from noise:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Spikes in power spectra.</li>
		<li>Gaussian rises and falls in transmission power, possibly representing the telescope beam's main lobe passing over a radio source.</li>
		<li>Triplets â€” three power spikes in a row.</li>
		<li>Pulsing signals that possibly represent a narrowband digital-style transmission.</li>
		<li>Autocorrelation detects signal waveforms.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>There are many variations on how an ETI signal may be affected by the interstellar medium, and by relative motion of its origin compared to Earth. The potential "signal" is thus processed in a number of ways (although not testing all detection methods nor scenarios) to ensure the highest likelihood of distinguishing it from the scintillating noise already present in all directions of outer space. For instance, another planet is very likely to be moving at a speed and acceleration with respect to Earth, and that will shift the frequency, over time, of the potential "signal". Checking for this through processing is done, to an extent, in the SETI@home software.</p>
	<p>The process is rather like tuning a radio to various channels, and looking at the signal strength meter. If the strength of the signal goes up, that gets attention. More technically, it involves a lot of digital signal processing, mostly discrete Fourier transforms at various chirp rates and durations.</p>
	<p>To date, the project has not confirmed the detection of any ETI signals (see extraterrestrial intelligence). However, it has identified several candidate targets (sky positions), where the spike in intensity is not easily explained as noisespots, for further analysis.</p>
