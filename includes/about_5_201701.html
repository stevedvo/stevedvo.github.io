	<p>> Have been busy at work mainly building the English/Arabic multilingual site. Improving my knowledge and skills with WordPress in how to make it easier to build pages from common template parts which are constructed from Advanced Custom Fields. As well as investigating how WordPress deals with RTL languages, and finding an RTL version of Bootstrap to load at the appropriate time.</p>
	<p>> Also had a little task today to look into the Google reCAPTCHA on a site so that the client could use it on a different site of theirs. Not scrutinised exactly how this works before so was good to get my head into it and understand the process. Found it a little confusing to begin with, but then realised that the reCAPTCHA had NOT actually been implemented correctly on the site in the first place!</p>

	<p>> Had another little task today for the site I was working on recently which is looking to start advertising their products on Google Shopping. The issue they have is that a large number of their product images have their company watermark on them. This was added onto the images via a WordPress plug-in, but the option to keep the original un-watermarked images had not been checked [to save disk space usage, no doubt!] - but the problem is that Google do NOT like you to use watermarked images on their Shopping utility.</p>
	<p>> The client sent us a small number of the original images to see what we could do with them. One method would obviously be to just upload the new images to the media library then go through every product in the backend, and manually select the new image in each case. With literally thousands of products & images, this would be a very slow boring task!</p>
	<p>> Another option would be to store all the new images in a single directory on the server, then make amendments to the database to update the filepath that each image is pointing at... but hacking away at the DB in this way seemed a little scary - especially if doing this on a live site.</p>
	<p>> The solution I came up with was to export the WooCommerce product data to a CSV file and import in Excel. Put together a little formula to split out the filepath and filename of each of the images. Extracted all the original images that the client sent to us and dumped a Windows CMD directory listing into a text file. Imported the text file into Excel and did a lookup to see which of the original image filenames matched the filenames from the WooCommerce export, and which 'Uploads' subfolder these files reside in.</p>
	<p>> So then I could sort this by the folder hierarchy and fairly quickly just overwrite the image files in the correct 'Uploads' subfolder [after backing up first, obviously!]. Another bit of complexity is that when uploading files into the WP media library it automatically creates smaller thumbnail versions of each image [typically a set of 3 or 4 files per image] - which were also being used on the back- and front-end. So to solve this I ran a Photoshop batch operation to resize the images to specified dimensions, and then figured out how to put together a rename command at the Windows cmd prompt to append the correct 'XXXxYYY' width & height numerals to the resized files.</p>
	<p>> Also, to keep file sizes low, I ran everything through <a href="https://tinypng.com/" target="_blank">TinyPNG</a> before I copied them over to the server. It took a nice little bit of figuring out various things: exporting data, importing data, Excel formulae, batch jobs, etc., but I got the whole process nailed down and I was quite pleased with the result in the end and am confident that the process could be repeated for the remainder of the original files when they become available.</p>

	<h4>23 January 2017</h4>
	<p>> Started work on new new project today: a website build for a site which will have an Arabic translation as part of it. Not done an awful lot of work before on multilingual WordPress sites, let alone ones which require a Right-to-Left conversion, but it looks like an interesting project and one which will certainly help me with learning lots.</p>
	<p>> Even without yet having fully signed-off PSD designs, we had enough to do go to get cracking: set my local machine up for development of the project, created a BitBucket repo. Did some reading-up on some plug-ins for translation, and through searches of the WP Codex and previous projects I collected several snippets of code to help me with creating custom post types, additional options pages, etc.</p>
	<p>> Ran through the pages that I could see from the web-based prototype and put together a plan of what I'd need to put on the templates, and started creating the theme with the custom post types and Advanced Custom Fields, and putting the page structure and menus together.</p>

	<h4>20 January 2017</h4>
	<p>> A task came across my desk today to look into a site to put on some Google tracking [pay-per-click] and supply a product feed that can be used for Google Shopping. Not an area I was familiar with, but I had some time to read up about the theory behind what's going on whilst the site files were downloading and I was setting things up in the background with BitBucket repos and branches, etc. Managed the first half of the task OK - found a PHP file that is called upon a successful transaction and looked up what methods I can call for the WooCommerce $order object to return the variables that the Google tracking code needs. The 2nd part was quite tricky - don't seem to be able to export the Product list from WooCommerce in the required XML format for the Google Merchant Centre. Found one or two plug-ins that ought to do the job, but these will need to be paid for.</p>
	<p>> Quite a frustrating end to the day doing what should have been a fairly simple task: grab the site files & DB from a 3rd-party server [which we had the login credentials for], spin up a new install on WPEngine and host the site from there. Anticipated maybe just 30 mins to create a new live WPEngine install, then copy over the site files through FileZilla, amend the SQL export from &lt;staging domain&gt; to &lt;WPEngine domain&gt; and import. It was not that simple! Despite the DB supposedly coming from the staging site the WP settings were pointing at the live domain so when I tried to navigate to the WPEngine site it was taking me to the old site! Tried to fix that with some more DB tweaks but was getting flummoxed as to why it wasn't working. Tried various things, including attempting to restore the install back to it's original state [although THAT failed somehow!]. Getting a bit tired and frustrated towards the end of the day I asked for some assistance and I was pointed towards the WPEngine caching which was causing some of the problems.</p>
	<p>> Eventually managed to get the site up & running as well as I expected: there are still several things not quite right but these are down to the theme settings not getting copied over with the site files & DB. I have no idea how the theme stores this info but on several of the themes that this particular client favours there is more tweaking to do once the main files have been imported.</p>

	<h4>18 January 2017</h4>
	<p>> Had a play with a couple of other sites at the end of the day: one on DotNetNuke which needed some content tweaks; and one on Magento which had a bug regarding an inability to upload images for products. The Magento issue was caused by some SWF files that were missing from one of the folders - unbelievable that it relies on Flash!! Found copies of the files on a 3rd-party public GitHub repo, and with these I was able to fix the fault on the local version of the site. It became apparent then that those files had been intentionally removed a few months ago due to security concerns! Will maybe look for better solutions to implement a fix on the live site...</p>

	<h4>17 January 2017</h4>
	<p>> It's been a little while since my last Blog update. It has been rather a busy time with the Christmas holidays and then the birth of my new boy! I had taken a couple of weeks leave to help out with things and get in some crucial daddy-boy bonding time, but I am back at work now. Whilst I was at home, I did manage to get in a few sessions of coding my own projects: my main focus has been the PHP Shopping List app that I started last month. Quite a fun little project working with PHP & MySQL to get something useful out of it and help with the grocery shopping.</p>
