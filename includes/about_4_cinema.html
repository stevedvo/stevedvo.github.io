<p>I'm quite a movie fan - and there is no better place to enjoy the latest releases than at the cinema, preferably without other cinemagoers crunching popcorn or rustling sweet-wrappers but you can't have everything!</p>
<p>The large screen, the immersive surround sound - a good film should get you lost inside of it and captivate you for its duration. A lot of people get bored after 80-90 mins and consider this the longest that anything should be, but I disagree with this. As long as the plot is good and moves at the right pace, I can be quite happily fully engaged with a movie 2 or 3 hours long - the limiting factor here being the comfort of the seats or the fullness of the bladder rather than boredom.</p>
<p>I do very much like the new generation of 3D movies that help with that: be it animated or live-action. I don't very much care for 3D "gimmicky" effects just for the sake of it, but movies filmed with 3D in mind that just give you that extra sense of depth for everyday normal scenes I think bring so much more realism that you could almost just be sitting in a theatre watching a play right in front of you. The progression of fully computer-animated films over the last 20 or so years has been astounding - Pixar movies especially seemingly leading the way: jaw-droppingly good visual effects that have increasingly become so lifelike there are some scenes which these days could easily be mistaken for live-action; and stories that can give a hefty tug on the heart-strings and just work so well on every level to entertain youngsters and adults alike.</p>
<p>I've been a keen regular visitor to various cinemas since my mid- to late-teens. Whilst I was at university, the local UGC cinema in Sheffield [now a Cineworld] had an "unlimited cinema" account that you could set up, and there were times that I really got good value out of this! For just a tenner a month I would sometimes see up to 7/8 films in the month, or often 2/3 per visit if I had time outside of studying/work. Whether with friends or on my own, this was a great opportunity to go and see movies that I might have otherwise not been that bothered about spending money to see, but more often was excellent for seeing movies that I really liked more than once at no extra cost. The Matrix trilogy springs to mind here! But inevitably, as the monthly cost increased year-on-year and my available free time decreased as I took up full-time employment, I realised that the "unlimited cinema" offer was no longer an economically viable option for me. Sad times :(</p>
<p>I still like to go the cinema a couple of times a month, if time allows.</p>
