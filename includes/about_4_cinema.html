		<p>I'm quite a movie fan - and there is no better place to enjoy the latest releases than at the cinema, preferably without other cinemagoers crunching popcorn or rustling sweet-wrappers but you can't have everything!</p>
		<p>The large screen, the immersive surround sound - a good film should get you lost inside of it and captivate you for its duration. A lot of people get bored after 80-90 mins and consider this the longest that anything should be, but I disagree with this. As long as the plot is good and moves at the right pace, I can be quite happily fully engaged with a movie 2 or 3 hours long - the limiting factor here being the comfort of the seats or the fullness of the bladder rather than boredom.</p>
		<p>I do very much like the new generation of 3D movies that help with that: be it animated or live-action. I don't very much care for 3D "gimmicky" effects just for the sake of it, but movies filmed with 3D in mind that just give you that extra sense of depth for everyday normal scenes I think bring so much more realism that you could almost just be sitting in a theatre watching a play right in front of you. The progression of fully computer-animated films over the last 20 or so years has been astounding - Pixar movies especially seemingly leading the way: jaw-droppingly good visual effects that have increasingly become so lifelike there are some scenes which these days could easily be mistaken for live-action; and stories that can give a hefty tug on the heart-strings and just work so well on every level to entertain youngsters and adults alike.</p>
		<p>I've been a keen regular visitor to various cinemas since my mid- to late-teens. Whilst I was at university, the local UGC cinema in Sheffield [now a Cineworld] had an "unlimited cinema" account that you could set up, and there were times that I really got good value out of this! For just a tenner a month I would sometimes see up to 7/8 films in the month, or often 2/3 per visit if I had time outside of studying/work. Whether with friends or on my own, this was a great opportunity to go and see movies that I might have otherwise not been that bothered about spending money to see, but more often was excellent for seeing movies that I really liked more than once at no extra cost. The Matrix trilogy springs to mind here! But inevitably, as the monthly cost increased year-on-year and my available free time decreased as I took up full-time employment, I realised that the "unlimited cinema" offer was no longer an economically viable option for me. Sad times :(</p>
		<p>I still like to go the cinema a couple of times a month, if time allows.</p>

		<h4>Independence Day: Resurgence</h4>
		<p>I watched the original Independence Day at the cinema in my mid-teens and remember being absolutely blown away by it. Excellent storyline, fantastic special effects, always ranked as one of my favourite movies of my youth. Seen it several times in the following 20 years, and although some of the SFX look a little ropey by today's standards it is still up there. So a sequel was always going to have to be something quite special to live up to the name.</p>
		<p>My initial thoughts were very positive. I really liked the premise that in the couple of decades since we last looked at this Universe the Earth here has undergone a great technological revolution, utilising the recovered alien tech to make new weapons and defence systems, anti-grav transport, and establishing a lunar base - all with a newfound global peaceful co-operation since the question of "are we alone in the Universe" had been emphatically answered. Was also a good thought that despite the alien ships crashing on Earth the battle wasn't actually over, and bloody ground combat had also taken place to eliminate the invading army.</p>
		<p>So there were lots of good ideas going on here, and a lot of potential. As the movie progressed we also learned more about the aliens that attacked Earth, their reasons for doing so, and of course their intention to come back and hit us harder after their first attempt was thwarted.</p>
		<p>The pace of the movie was OK but not perfect. There was some history between a couple of the main characters i.e. something had happened which made them hate each other, but then because they have to work together to stop the new threat they "kiss and make up". Bit of a pointless side-story in my opinion - didn't add anything worthwhile to the movie and was an unnecessary distraction.</p>
		<p>Despite the aliens returning with an even bigger threat, I just somehow didn't feel that there was a large enough sense of a threat or jeopardy. Whilst Will Smith was able to carry off a little humour in the original, I think they have over-compensated for his absence and it was a little overdone this time. Maybe a slightly darker tone would have been better to portray a genuine sense of impending doom. It's Hollywood: we all know that of course the baddies aren't going to win in the end, but despite how much the planet gets wrecked their ultimate loss never really seemed to be in doubt. There is a welcome return of a few characters from the original, and their experiences and psychic connection to the aliens is used as an important part of the plot.</p>
		<p>The astrophysicist in me couldn't help but be slightly annoyed at some of the physics that was going on. The gravity on the moon didn't seem to differ much from Earth, although I could console myself that the ability to simulate/manipulate gravity may be a part of the alien tech - hence the flying machines. But an alien ship THAT size (3,000 miles diameter if I recall correctly - larger than the moon!) which was pulling people, vehicles, buildings, oceans UP towards it due to its immense mass then settles on Earth and there are no other after-effects? This would surely cause havoc with the moon's orbit.</p>
		<p>The special effects were - as expected - spectacular, and complimented by watching this in 3D.</p>
		<p>Overall I did enjoy the movie, despite the negative points that I picked up on. It was good but it could have been better, and it is certainly worth a watch if you are a fan of the original. From the way that the plot progressed I get the impression that the writers/producers are rather looking to create a very profitable franchise from this with at least one more movie on the cards - and another follow-up could well have a lot of potential as Earth join forces with other aliens in the galaxy to take on a common enemy.</p>

		<h4>Star Trek Beyond</h4>
		<p>I was rather looking forward to this next instalment in the movie franchise. I didn't know a lot about it going in, only really that Simon Pegg had contributed to the writing, which gave me more reason to look forward to it!</p>
		<p>I wouldn't say I was absolutely blown away by it, but it is certainly a very enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours. The story is good and moves along at a sensible pace. This was another movie I saw in 3D and the SFX were very good indeed, from the mind-bending arrangement of the starbase to the exquisite movement of the attacking enemy ships - which are described as "bees" but reminded me an awful lot of the "sentinels" in the Matrix trilogy.</p>
		<p>As well as the elements of jeopardy and drama, there is a good injection of humour in the movie - and I found myself well caught up in it and willing the "goodies" to succeed in defeating the "baddies" to save the starbase from destruction.</p>
		<p>It has been at least a couple of years since I saw the first two movies in this rebooted version of the franchise, and I could barely remember what happened in them. There were a few references to these events which I therefore didn't quite appreciate upon watching "Beyond", such as "New Vulcan" and why Nimoy's Ambassador Spock seemed to be known to Quinto's new Spock incarnation. I figured some parallel-universe type thing had perhaps already previously been established, and some post-watching Wikipedia reading of the plot synopses got my memory jogged and confirmed my suspicions along with reminding me of several other forgotten plot points. In hindsight, I do kinda wish I'd watched "Star Trek" and "Into Darkness" more recently to refresh my memory, although all it did was leave me slightly intrigued rather than severely affecting my enjoyment of this movie.</p>
		<p>A lot seemed to be made a few weeks ago of the 'outing' of new Sulu being homosexual. The original actor, George Takei [who 'came out' as gay only relatively recently], was dead against it - stating that it changes the character created by Roddenberry. Pegg defended it, saying that when The Original Series was first shown [in the 60's] it was enough of a shock to have black people on telly, let alone an inter-racial kiss. Back in those days there was only so far that you could push the envelope, but Roddenberry's vision was for a much more open free society where these things were not seen as taboos but just ordinary life. Having now seen the movie I agree with Pegg. There is not really any mention of it, it is just one very short scene where all the crew are disembarking the Enterprise at the starbase for some r&r and meet up with their friends/family that are waiting for them. We see Sulu walking away with his spouse and daughter, and that's it! By today's standards, and certainly by the standards of what we might imagine to be 'normal' 200 years in the future, I don't see anything wrong with this at all. Sure, it does deviate from the character that Takei played, but as mentioned above this is a parallel-universe / alternate-reality version of the franchise - and as such the writers have the freedom to mould the characters and situations however they see fit, whilst keeping true to Roddenberry's vision and not being burdened with problems of continuity with the rest of the canon.</p>
		<p>In short: a good film, if not spectacular. Glad to have seen it on the big screen, and I recommend that others do too.</p>

		<h4>Finding Dory</h4>
		<p>The long-awaited sequel of the much-loved "Finding Nemo", the movie takes place around a year after the events of it's predecessor and focuses on Dory's quest to firstly remember her family and then to try to find them.</p>
		<p>It's a cute film. It's a good story, and kept me interested: a good injection of humour throughout the film and mildly dramatic sticky-situations that the principle characters have to get themselves out of. Nice to see some characters return from the original movie, as well as introducing several new ones critical to the story with their own unique entertaining characteristics. I suppose it could be criticised for not really bringing much original to the plate... but it's a sequel - so whaddaya expect?</p>
		<p>I enjoyed it for the story and characters, at no point did I feel that I was bored. The development of Dory's character is aided by the use of flashbacks to her younger (super-cute) self as she remembers critical information about her parents and surroundings, which I think helps with the emotional involvement. I can't quite put my finger on it but I somehow felt that the ending was a little anti-climactic / flat, however.</p>
		<p>As with all Pixar movies, one of the things that I enjoyed most about it was the exquisite and beautiful animation. Every time I see a Pixar movie I am in awe of the level of detail that they put into the textures, and the adherence to the laws of physics. Particularly noticeable for me were the internal reflections of the characters / objects at the top surface of the water which gave an extra level of realism. Thinking about it, I don't recall noticing if they'd taken refraction into account - maybe that means that they did and it just appeared so natural it didn't even occur to me!</p>
		<p> The short film before the main feature, "Piper", was at least equally exquisite if not more so. Every grain of sand on the beach, every movement of the water on the land and in the sea, basically everything looked photo-realistic and behaved in an expected believable way. I think it would be difficult to distinguish between this computer-animated film and actual real-life footage. Stunning. And this was even in 2D - had I seen the 3D version I'm sure my senses would have been in for even more of a treat.</p>
