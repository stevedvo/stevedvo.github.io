		<p>CRITICAL FIRST HOUR</p>
		<p>Sepsis is an emergency, just like heart attacks and stroke. The good news is, life-saving treatment for sepsis is often relatively straightforward. International recommendations suggest that treatment should be started within one hour of sepsis being suspected. Research has shown that treatment with intravenous antibiotics and fluids works.</p>
		<p>Early recognition, and getting basic treatments including antibiotics and fluids into the patient within the first hour, can halt the progression of sepsis and hugely improve outcomes for patients. Antibiotics can cause harm if given inappropriately. Doctors should always prescribe antibiotics with caution. In the case of sepsis, however, they are the single most important lifesaving measure.</p>
		<p>The <a href="http://sepsistrust.org/" target="_blank">UK Sepsis Trust</a> recommends a set of treatments known as the ‘Sepsis Six’, which is a set of interventions that can be can be administered by junior nurses and doctors, and have been shown to double the chance of survival - especially if all carried out within the first hour of admission.</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Administer high flow oxygen.</li>
				<li>Take blood cultures.</li>
				<li>Give broad-spectrum antibiotics.</li>
				<li>Give intravenous fluid challenges.</li>
				<li>Measure serum lactate and haemoglobin.</li>
				<li>Measure accurate hourly urine output.</li>
			</ol>

		<p>Early intervention with the Sepsis Six certainly saves lives, but has also been shown to reduce length of hospital stay and need for Critical Care admission. Excellent news for patients, relatives, AND the strained NHS budget!</p>
