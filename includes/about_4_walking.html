<p>There have been periods in my life where I have been naturally active: I walked at least a couple of miles if not more every day to get to & from college, whilst at university I had a part-time jobs working on a shop floor and therefore on my feet and rushing around a lot. However, since working full-time in various offices and spending most of the day on a chair my natural levels of activity have diminished and my waistline has increased.</p>
<p>I have been aware enough of this for long enough to be reasonably careful about not over-indulging too much, and to try to make the effort to get outside and do something active whenever the time allows. I am under no impression that I am actually overweight, but based on BMI I am approaching the upper-end of the "Ideal" band rather than being nearer the middle where I was a few years ago.</p>
<p>So to try and combat this and improve my overall health & fitness I like to go out for at least a half-hour walk every day, if not longer, and to try to hit 10,000 steps each day if I can. I don't succeed every day, but I think just always being mindful of it helps and encourages me to try to use my legs rather than the car when possible. Running is not for me! - it puts far too much pressure on the joints for my liking - but at the brisk pace I tend to walk at many iPhone apps are easily fooled into thinking I am actually running! On a short walk [&lt;3km] I usually aim for &lt;8:00 mins per km; on a longer walk I try to keep up a pace of 9:00 mins per km or quicker. I try to find local circular routes away from traffic if I can, and living in a smallish Wiltshire town it's not difficult to find quiet country lanes to explore.</p>
