	<p>Cosmology@Home is run from the Department of Astronomy and Physics at the University of Illinois with the aim of comparing theoretical models of the universe to the data measured to date and search for the model that best matches it. Results from this project could also help to:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>design future cosmological observations and experiments.</li>
		<li>prepare for the analysis of future data sets, e.g. from the Planck spacecraft.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The goal of Cosmology@Home is to search for the model that best describes our Universe and to find the range of models that agree with the available astronomical and particle physics data. The models generated by Cosmology@home can be compared to measurements of the universe's expansion speed from the Hubble Space Telescope as well as fluctuations in the cosmic background radiation as measured by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe.</p>
	<p>Cosmology@Home uses an innovative way of using machine learning to effectively parallelize a large computational task that involves many inherently sequential calculations over an extremely large number of distributed computers.</p>
	<p>For any given class of theoretically possible models of the Universe, Cosmology@Home generates tens of thousands of example Universes and packages the cosmological parameters describing these Universes as work units. Each work unit represents a single Universe. When the work unit is requested by a participating computer, this computer simulates this Universe from the Big Bang until today. The result of this simulation is a list of observable properties of this Universe.</p>
	<p>This result is then sent back and archived at the Cosmology@Home server. When a sufficient number of example Universes have been simulated, a machine learning algorithm learns from these example calculations how to do the simulation for any Universe similar to the example Universes.</p>
