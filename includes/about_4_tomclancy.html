<p>I first enjoyed the works of Tom Clancy before I even realised it. In my mid-teens there were a couple of movies that I enjoyed which both starred Harrison Ford but I didn't realise were otherwise related and didn't make the connexion: "Clear And Present Danger" and "Patriot Games". It was only a little later - perhaps shortly before "The Sum Of All Fears" movie was released - that I cottoned-on to the fact that these were all based on Tom Clancy novels, and I was intrigued enough to look into this some more [as much as possible before Wikipedia!] and buy one of the novels that these movies were based on.</p>
<p>I don't recall now actually which the first novel was that I read - it might have been "Patriot Games" - but in any case I was hooked. It is an incontrovertible rule of the Universe that a novel is always better than any movie which is based upon it, and - as good as the Harrison Ford movies are - Clancy's novels are perfect examples. The level of technical detail which he put into each of his novels is amazing and far more than could be crammed into a 90-120 minute movie. The way he structures his stories and builds things to a climax at an appropriate pace is riveting. His earlier works tended to focus on Cold War themes - spies, Russian agents - and later works involve Islamic terrorism, wars with / between China, Russia and Japan, and all the political fallout that entails.</p>
<p>Over the course of several years I have gradually either bought or been gifted all of his "Ryanverse" novels and have enjoyed reading every one of them, following the progress of not just the main protagonist but all of the secondary characters too - a couple of whom have their own spin-off novel series & video games [Jack Ryan, Jr. & John Clark a.k.a. "Rainbow Six"].</p>
<p>Although Clancy passed away in 2013, his characters live on in novels written by his previous writing partners - which are still pretty good but do seem to lack a bit of the Clancy pizazz.</p>
