	<p style="margin-top: 10px;">yoyo@home is not actually a project in itself but utilises the "BOINC Wrapper" technology to bring other previously non-BOINC distributed computing projects to the BOINC world.</p>
	<p>yoyo@home is currently running the following sub-projects:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>ECM is a program for Elliptic Curve Factorization which is used by a couple of projects to find factors for different kind of numbers.</li>
		<li>Muon simulates and designs parts of a particle accelerator. The application simulates the part of the process where the proton beam hits the target rod and causes pions to be emitted, which decay into muons.</li>
		<li>evolution@home represents the first and so far only distributed computing project addressing evolutionary research. It simulates different types of populations and focuses on the analysis of human mitochondrial DNA.</li>
		<li>Cruncher is a distributed.net client and runs OGR work units. This project searches for the shortest Optimal Golumb Ruler of the length 28.</li>
	</ul>
