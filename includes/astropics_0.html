	<p>One of my oldest interests is with Astronomy.</p>
	<p>Whilst I was at Uni and working part-time I purchased a Nikon digital camera and an 8" reflecting telescope, and over time I have collected various eyepieces & accessories to enable me to take pictures of what I can see. Here are a few of them, organised into various categories. Enjoy!</p>
